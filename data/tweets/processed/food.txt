 @sophiaphotos Awesome. Since you are a vegan and food photographer, I would suggest a worm composter outside your building somewhere (or in a closet in your building). I have one in my home (no smell and it's clean). You can purchase very pretty ones. I'll post mine.

 @thelittleidiot @RancidTarzie People do make it subjective- For example, they will argue that gluten/seitan, olive oil, & veggie burgers are junk. Basically anything "processed" or not a "whole food". I prefer to prioritize the total de-funding of animal ag before we get into which foods are healthy/junk.
 @theneedledrop Also coming from someone who is poorI actually cant afford to eat fast food, junk food etc much anymore because of how much cheaper it is to by food from the grocery store. So few people seem to get that though

 @WSJ @PCRM @Carrion_Crawl @Hemp4Honey @Serial_Tragedy The law requires we all wear seat belts, helmets, have car ins., med ins. I don't like it, but understand why. Should food stamps be spent on soda, candy, chips?  Junk food isn't food. Why not add alcohol & cigarettes? Same thinking.

 Because we work 12 hr shifts, sometimes our lunch break isn’t until 1 or 2 (afternoon or night).   Therefore, we have to have food/drinks on hand while we work. But it never fails…..#RPS911 #ThinGoldLine #NPSTW2018 pic.twitter.com/k1FPwbPd6j
 I decided that the food should be tupperwared and eaten later when I’m around people in the break room.

 @ArthurDelaneyHP It is incredibly difficult to buy healthy foods when using SNAP.  People try to buy so they get the most bang for their buck.

 @peta @TheKitchensHeat @lilbratzzdoll @ryanunlimited There’s more ethical ways to provide food than mercilessly beating the life out these animals. More humane less selfish ways. And comparing it to other problems doesn’t solve the problem we’re discussing here. Food is a gift and we should respect the animals ALL animals anyway.

 @vegan_future @CompAugustine @BasedBogan @cerebralsymphoy @kathryn_dick @shaunfarrington It's not possible to kill an animal humanely, it literally defies the definition.

 There's a middle ground from what Moby is saying and poor people should be able to eat whatever junk food they want on food stamps. Snake cakes, sodas; certain foods that have no nutritional should be banned. They can always make their own unhealthy snacks from scratch.

 @skyallred @ArthurDelaneyHP @Tofu_Terrorist It's neither progressive nor empathetic to restrict what people buy with food stamps. Yes, better food should be more widely available at lower costs, but restrictions on food stamps isn't the way.

 perhaps it's good to keep in the back of your mind that all of this doesn't make up a series of coincidences. less healthy foods are more convenient and kept at lower prices to target the economically unstable - just capitalism systematically fucking over poor ppl in america
 sure, it's certainly not the healthiest, but it's sustenance. try to get a little kid (of any socioeconomic background) to eat their veggies and tell me how it goes. also important to note that so-called "healthy foods" are much more expensive than the opposite.
 Clean, healthy food delivered to your door. Perfectly measured #macros ensuring your nutrition…   
 so, with parents working comparatively more hours for less money, kids are often left to feed themselves. in this case, you have to look at it logically. hand a kid a pile of produce and expect them to craft a meal? nah. easy mac? cereal? microwavable foods? doable for a six yo!
 ALSO, reports state that those using SNAP benefits do not, in fact, consume proportionally more junk food. thus, all of this controversy is just entitled people feeling a need to dictate the lives of the less fortunate. (pdf 4 ref:   … )

 @BenDWalsh @thejonny_c None of those things are all that healthy, especially if you are a diabetic or prediabetic. Healthy food is fresh produce and low fat meats. Those are the most expensive foods and the foods not available in food deserts. Please educate yourself.
 @aterkel @ArthurDelaneyHP @redenigma @silimofo2001 @matt7738 @TheDoseTweets @azbychaveaux People in food deserts have to travel farther to get groceries, often prohibitively far for fresh stuff/heavy items. They eat what is less time/$$, ie what they can find.Curtailing what SNAP can be used for would make finding food more difficult.

 A lot of people seem confused on what cultural appropriation is, so I’ll break it down.IT IS NOT: Enjoying food, music, and art from another culture or learning about their language and religion.IT IS: Using a culture as a costume, and treating race like a mascot.
 @BenDWalsh @thejonny_c @owingso @LauriLinnea @AliasEmanon Corn is a great example of a GMO it was originally useless as a food until we modified it to grow more of the edible parts and made it what we know of today.

 @LeonidasBowman Not by default sir. The Left is organized and hungry people can quite march, drive the the countryside. Also bear in mind most food is corporate farmed, corporate delivered. To sever LOCs (Lines of Communication) takes organized, sustained force. We have no organization.

 @BenDWalsh @kreamycheese I think SNAP should be rationed. Only $15 to go for “junk” out of every $100, and only $30 go to processed foods (like hamburger helper, which I despise, but people DO work and have kids...). That’s $55 out of $100. That $45 would buy meat, fresh veggies, beans, etc.

 @TamarHaspel @melissamcewen @MatthewJDalby @1tsS4r So why don't we eat all of the food all the time? I think there are real issues of satiety (as opposed to "deficiency") not being addressed.

 No one goes hungry for a lack of resources. As a society solved the issue of food production a century ago. In our system, market forces determine what you eat, or if you eat. Junk food and food deserts are a needless, market phenomenon.All food scarcity is political.

 @WSJ @PCRM @Carrion_Crawl @devonnalisa I agree. We tested the theory w/a friend who got #SNAP after a job loss. She and her kids ate healthy. Junk food lasts a few days. Beans, rice, pasta and veggies lasted longer. If people want an excuse, they'll always find one. Bag of chips $4, bag of oranges $3.

 @aterkel @ArthurDelaneyHP @TheDoseTweets @redenigma @jambie61 If you want chips and candy bars, buy that with money that isn't part of the food stamp program.  It's not saying that people on food stamps can't have that type of food, it's just saying that the program should not pay for that portion of their food.

 4. SNAP benefits are low. If a family buys cheaper food to stretch the dollar, then maybe the family isn't to blame. However, the program costs aren't necessarily high because each dollar used in SNAP generates $1.79 for the economy.

 @JasnTru I don't get that. The whole time I lived in Tokyo the nicest people I've ever met were all from Kyushu, and specifically the Fukuoka area. Was a splendid place to visit as well.  Much cheaper cost of living, more space, better food.

 Yes, I understand that Moby's intention was to say that low income people deserve a better quality of food.  While that is true, food deserts are real.  People don't have multiple options.  Instead of moralizing about poverty, Moby could spend money to combat food insecurity.
 You slandering ketchup ??  RT @DrunkUncleP: Ketchup is trash tho but how you slander spicy food? Nah dog.
 @jhvilas Also, I can't read the full op-ed because it's paywalled where I am. But the headline is "food stamps shouldn't pay for junk," which is a super-bad take.If that's a bad headline and the excerpts I can see are unfair to that premise, well, that happens.
 Never thought I'd say this, but Moby needs to have a seat.  Here's an idea: how about multimillionaires who don't depend of assistance for food stop telling people who do what they should or shouldn't have available to them.This is literally a talking point from the GOP.
