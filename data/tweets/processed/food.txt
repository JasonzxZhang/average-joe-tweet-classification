 @sophiaphotos Awesome. Since you are a vegan and food photographer, I would suggest a worm composter outside your building somewhere (or in a closet in your building). I have one in my home (no smell and it's clean). You can purchase very pretty ones. I'll post mine.

 @thelittleidiot @RancidTarzie People do make it subjective- For example, they will argue that gluten/seitan, olive oil, & veggie burgers are junk. Basically anything "processed" or not a "whole food". I prefer to prioritize the total de-funding of animal ag before we get into which foods are healthy/junk.
 @theneedledrop Also coming from someone who is poorI actually cant afford to eat fast food, junk food etc much anymore because of how much cheaper it is to by food from the grocery store. So few people seem to get that though

 @WSJ @PCRM @Carrion_Crawl @Hemp4Honey @Serial_Tragedy The law requires we all wear seat belts, helmets, have car ins., med ins. I don't like it, but understand why. Should food stamps be spent on soda, candy, chips?  Junk food isn't food. Why not add alcohol & cigarettes? Same thinking.

 I’m ready to go home and eat some food
 Eating stuff that doesnt look like food, making dirt in a box of gravel, sticking their noses outside only when the Twolegs allow them?
 Because we work 12 hr shifts, sometimes our lunch break isn’t until 1 or 2 (afternoon or night).   Therefore, we have to have food/drinks on hand while we work. But it never fails…..#RPS911 #ThinGoldLine #NPSTW2018 pic.twitter.com/k1FPwbPd6j
 I decided that the food should be tupperwared and eaten later when I’m around people in the break room.

 A10 - THIS. I am very policy centered because if we do not correct the conditions that have created food and healthcare systems that are inadequate or inequitable, all of the work done at the individual level is somewhat in vain. #CareWomenDeserve #DontTouchMyCare

 When Tories sold off British Gas 30 years ago, who would have guessed that profiteers would continue to rip off consumers for so long...it didn't take a great feat of imagination. Prices go up 5.5%, nrly double inflation. Consumers decide between heat OR food! #EnergyCap #r4today pic.twitter.com/oRbjidw3mE
 @byundricklamar some good fuckin food
 @PHCukorg @Diabetescouk @lowcarbGP More factors: We traded quantity for quality, buying far less food overall. We eat out less & less over time, just like my keto cooking better. We have 2.5 freezers & buy quality meat & seafood on sale.

 @ArthurDelaneyHP It is incredibly difficult to buy healthy foods when using SNAP.  People try to buy so they get the most bang for their buck.
 @CBCNews @Adm_Right Sexist historic inaccuracy and delusional male ego to focus on the pride and status of hunting when women, foraging and gathering plants, supplied the majority of food for societies. And the real advancement of society has come not from hunting but from agriculture.
 I’ve been trying to finish my food all day and for some reason I have no appetite
 @EricVespe La hacienda de san angel. It usually has availability, food is delicious, and amazing if you're able to catch the fireworks.
 @ArthurDelaneyHP The discussion about what SNAP should buy is always, always about poor shaming. There are so many other things wrong & some poor person might eat some unhealthy (by what standard) food. Because poor people need our input because we know better? that
 There's nothing better than Golden Krust when it comes to Jamaican food.

 @Mydailymotherb1 I get such bad health anxiety when I don't. I like that healthy meals are cheap to make. I just wish that fresh food kept longer than it does as I can't always go out to get more and I refuse to spend £40 on a delivery when most fresh food that arrives is dated that day or next.
