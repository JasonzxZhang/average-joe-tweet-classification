 @sophiaphotos Awesome. Since you are a vegan and food photographer, I would suggest a worm composter outside your building somewhere (or in a closet in your building). I have one in my home (no smell and it's clean). You can purchase very pretty ones. I'll post mine.

 Fast food employee's 'beautiful' act of kindness goes viral    #FoxNews
 @thelittleidiot @RancidTarzie People do make it subjective- For example, they will argue that gluten/seitan, olive oil, & veggie burgers are junk. Basically anything "processed" or not a "whole food". I prefer to prioritize the total de-funding of animal ag before we get into which foods are healthy/junk.
 @theneedledrop Also coming from someone who is poorI actually cant afford to eat fast food, junk food etc much anymore because of how much cheaper it is to by food from the grocery store. So few people seem to get that though

 @WSJ @PCRM @Carrion_Crawl @Hemp4Honey @Serial_Tragedy The law requires we all wear seat belts, helmets, have car ins., med ins. I don't like it, but understand why. Should food stamps be spent on soda, candy, chips?  Junk food isn't food. Why not add alcohol & cigarettes? Same thinking.
