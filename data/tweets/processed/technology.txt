 @MardyGoth The thing is, you could argue that technology has made books so accessible that libraries are no longer needed which is obviously a good thing. In the future they’ll mainly be for poor people having internet access.

 @MikeTokes was off topic...this was about data sharing and a most of not all of those senators were ignorant about Facebook and technology in general, it's not even funny. I'm no fan of Zuckerberg but he was probably beside himself with the ignorance in that room.
