  To me, their records are still great. But I also recognize how crucial they were to introducing me to not only a certain style of music - jangly, power-pop leaning things - but also to specific artists I wouldn't expect.
  The books are fine, as is some of my music, bc Google drive...But the rest of my music...and my series...and my movies...
  @Brittany_207 this can also be a curse when the music is associated with a memory or a person or pace you care to forget or maybe somebody you miss *tear falls**everybody hurts by rem plays softly in the background*

  I like Autechre, but I listen to them because I learn things from them. They're experts at what they do, and as someone else who makes music I want to understand them. That's about where it ends. I have no emotional attachment to anything Autechre have done.
  i just wanna know why my apple music has only been shuffling Drake, PND and A boogie. Tryna tell me something???
  secondly, this is the same old criticism of Kid A: that Radiohead made Aphex Twin and Autechre into pop music. To which I would say, yes. No shit. That's why it's great!
  #Firstplay: "Wave Music X - Trumpets for Dick Higgins" by Charlie Morrow on BBC Radio 6 Music (#BBC6Music)

  The last Dr Dre album was massively slept on. It’s such a shame it was just an Apple Music/ITunes release. Nobody got to hear it. Definite 8/10 at least

  Glad I'm not the only person who was pissed off by that Weird Records spiel when they read it. "total immersion in a solipsistic, de-materialised phantom world"- who can honestly say that that doesn't sound awesome and wouldn't want to hear the music from such a realm?   …

  @sqwarlock Amen, just listen to anything that gets your mind or body moving. The best music lovers are the ones that can recommend new stuff off damn near any other song as a source, not the snobbery folk.
  Also, i don’t know why people are sayin he’s bad. I mean that is a style of singing. It’s not bad, it’s just not your taste in music.

  Anyone who even dares come for MJs music. Who do they think they are. It is FACT that Michael was a musical genius. I always think back to his 1993 deposition where he literally explains the process in which he creates every single aspect of music in his head. A genius.

  Last thing I'm gonna say: There's nothing to actively promote. Queen Miss You is retired. She's done and over and not coming back. To be productive as a fan while he's working on his album, stream his music instead of whining to his official UA acting like you're a PR agent.

  @YKIGS @Edith83674755 That's one single you're talking about. Every artist has a weak single in their career. But Ciara had multiple weak singles beyond "Go Girl" and that just killed her.

  I don't think anybody is anybody else's moral compass. Maybe listening to my music is not the best idea if you live a very constricted life. Or maybe it is.
  @TheEllenShow I can say for a fact that this little boy has now introduced me to country music. His voice is so clear and operatic (good pitch and clarity) that I have listened to him sing three times now. I might have to rethink my loathing of country music. Naah... I like his singing only.

  Best support act I've seen is very close between You Me At Six supporting 30 Seconds to Mars, or Good Charlotte supporting All Time Low. I think Good Charlotte just beats YMAS though as I had listened to their music for probs about 14 years, plus ATL are my favourite band.

  @lukejamesbgn It matches their agenda. If she’s a confident female, she gets the praise reguardless of content. I didn’t think the album was bad at all, and I enjoy Cardi’s presence outside the music, but the two should never mix. That’s what is the problem.
  @YKIGS @Edith83674755 Yes, as an artist a good team is super important. But a great deal of the success is an artists own responsibility too. She clearly wanted to make the kind of music she made and it unfortunately just wasn't good enough.

  @YKIGS @Edith83674755 Why does every artist need to be Rihanna / Beyoncé level successful??? They're POPSTARS, not necessarily R&B artists.

  @williamlegate @hharriscpc Please, don't generalize I'm 73 and quite computer-literate.  It all depends whether you want to take advantage of new technologies, or if you still listen to the music you "grew up with", if you get my drift.
  When I show people something I'm working on then show them something completely different next time they always ask why I never stop and work on one track for a while. Music for me is a lot of motivation and passion, so if I'm not feeling something I'll scrap it and start fresh.

  Idk why autocorrect all of a sudden started changing my misspellings of “minutes” to “minuets,” because it’s drastically altered how I come across. “Hey I’ll be there in two minuets” makes me sound like a lunatic who measures time only in classical music composition.
  I just rewatched Star Wars ep VII and could hear @eavoss in my head telling me about relationships mirroring those from other movies, about the themes, styles used in the filmmaking and potential story arcs. And then @fimo telling me about the music use and composition choices.
  I don’t condone any of their actions but to those people think twice before commenting on what music people are listening to if you still bumping her. Side note this all coming from the headlines and stories. Idk her or the music lol

  Let’s be honest,no one wants to see you waving a blunt around, and smoking it, while blasting trap music in your Toyota.

  Remember when Daft Punk made full on anime clips for their music videos.

  Male rappers can reference comic book characters, anime characters, video game characters, wrestling, etc in their music & nobody will question whether they’re into these things. But when a Black female rapper labels her single “Chun Li” it’s an issue. Y’all are so annoying.

  Billboard can fix the metrics of the social 50 chart by requiring official US distribution of music for every artist in the category. I think that’s still fair. Every other category has that requirement. And if it still comes out as only Kpop nominees then so be it.

  @theodd1sout @ArmouredSkeptic @TheGarbageHuman Edit is a synonym for Alter, which in the context outside of animal sterilization, refers to changing something.Adding photos, is exactly this.

  I want my first creative project post graduation to be a music video. But it has to be to a song that I really love. I'm getting real excited thinking about it.
  @ProfRvach I think it was set to music, in Heritage Minutes.

  You know something I miss? Just lying in bed with nothing to do, maybe my earphones on and some background music, waiting for someone to be online and talk through the night with them until I fall asleep on my phone and apologize the morning after.
  MY music,
  This old man at the cafe just went up to the counter and asked for his “usual”, and the waitress sighed and switched the music to Bulgarian pop. He did not order anything else, I am in disbelief

  @Siha_Sam I want a guy to talk to at night in my room, just to chill here with me and talk every night. Or go on walks at night, or sit outside and look at the stars. I want to wake up and play music lying there with him, like they did in LiS. it's always the little things.

  Didn't much at all about @Logic301 until i watched his episode of Rapture on Netflix. Down right inspiring now I find myself jamming out too his music regularly. The songs Flexicution and Everyday are definitely some of my favorites hands down.

  @NautilusCarly She is so funny. Her reward for good behavior before bed is watching one direction music videos or Shawn Mendes  she talks about them like they're her besties and calls Harry styles her harrykins. 4 going on 14!
  Right now my biggest dream is to look Shawn in the eyes and tell him how freaking proud I am of him. He’s come so far and has gotten me through so much. I’m not even sure if I’d be here if it weren’t for his music so Shawn... thank you so much I love you so much!!
  I;m gna start a new band and we'll do scouting for girls style music and everyone will think its some avant garde post modern exercise in music snobbery but we'll make loads of cash and everyone will think its a joke but my pockets will be phat
  One thing though, no offense to Alan Silvestri's score for Ready Player One. But all I could hear in my own head was Vince Dicola's music playing in the background, exactly falling into the right places when I read the book.
  All this new music coming out from female artists lately is so refreshing.  The music scene has been an actual sausage fest for too long.

  @TravisOdyssey I think you can only market eurobeat to non-fans by its "memeness". Most people would rather listen to droning music that doesn't make you think much, or it has to be heavily-relateable. Eurobeat demands active listening and it's usually too cheesy for people.

  Christopher Willis’ music for Death of Stalin is simply perfect. It’s written in the mold of Shostakovich’s scores for Russian propaganda films such as The Fall of Berlin or The Unforgettable Year 1919. It’s the kind of classic soundtrack you don’t hear much anymore these days.
  i havent released music in quiet a while recently, and thats because im working on something special ;)

  @nowthisnews @Azpichannel I'd look at Spotify. It's a platform company built on users signing up yet you can also use Apple Music, Tidal, Amazon Music, Google Play, TuneIn, Pandora. The point is you have options and FB by design buys up competition.

  @MurderMayhemGuy To me a “new Juggalo” is someone whose made it past just being a fan of the music and who has started to discover the Dark Carnival. They are aware of it, are learning it first hand and are seeking more and more of it.

  I’ve never been excited for new Nicki music until today... and that’s only because I’m interested in seeing how she’s grown as an artist (on her own tracks, not features).

  For 1989 and at the time I was at a really bad place and her music really helped me get through my depression and she was there for me through all my hard times and I’m so lucky and grateful for her she’s the best role model  #welovetaylorswift
  With all this new music, summer is about to be lit  #NickiMinaj #CardiB #JanelleMonae #Drake
  And get my siblings mad sjsjs but honestly I didn’t have social media back then so I kinda fell out of loop until the 1989 era but I’d still listen to her music on the radio like ikywt and wanegbt. And when I found her again she had just announced the livestream
  #welovetaylorswift i remember going on YouTube and seeing the ybwm Mv or love story Mv I honestly don’t remember sjdj then after that I binged all her music videos and music and I stanned, then my aunt got me the fearless cd for my bday and I would always play it in the car
  @advncdhindsight @behscientist @danariely @kapilkantkaul It depends! Some studies find no adverse effect of background audio (you can basically let it play without paying attention) -- but I am confident that as soon as the music / audiobook gets complex and pulls at attention, you would see a similar effect.

  I don't enjoy shows of sullen indifference in students, but after having a chance to calm down a little, I get it. You go to music school to learn classical voice performance and then some guy is telling you to remix recordings instead? Why pay attention.
  @spacecrone He loves to research music and sometimes he'll take reference material -- a book, or a blog, or the list of studio personnel from the back of an LP -- and go through it methodically to encounter things he hasn't heard yet.
  You fans have no brains of your own! Why not just love the music & NOT the artists! But Instead they can tell you what to like & what not to like!

  is music getting more boring or am I getting more depressed
  @Iunajoon @noahmnot Yes, but you're not seeming to get that if nobody became interested in them this cb, they would still be in the same position as past cbs. So yes, this success is due to the influx of new fans coming in and streaming/buying their music along with Unis that have already been here.
  Mostly music today has involved an ear worm. The tune on repeat is happily a 3/2 hornpipe I love. Ear worms can be awful - like  any worms really!
  @zookmann Their opinions are as unwanted and lame as their music. Ignore them.
  @eurovisionisbae @H3nri98 It means to have a performers vocals mixed in with the music to find an equilibrium between live vocals and backing. It generally makes a performance sound more like the studio cut and avoids bad mishaps

  "Thursday" gives me the feeling of teenagers in 90's. The music flow is both young and memorable. I dun know...but these r my feelings anyway.#CBX_BloomingDays#花요일#PremiosMTVMiaw #MTVBRKPOPEXO@weareoneEXO
  "Lazy"is also one of 1980's Billboard songs' feelings. I dun understand music genre very well so, can't tell exactly what kind of genre I've got. I'll tell, all of songs in this album come from one root of genre.#CBX_BloomingDays#PremiosMTVMiaw #MTVBRKPOPEXO@weareoneEXO

  @HelIicious changing like an illusion, expanding into a great ball room. The floor polished to reflect just them, and a symphony of music that filled every inch of the space. A lively tempo lifting; elevating her spirit. The lyrics swimming through her cerebral cortex like a wakeful ~>
  From "Sweet Dreams" the feeling I've got is kinda1980's Best of the Best of Billboard songs. Their music arrangement takes me to my young age. I dun know how to describe..."the memory of youth?"#CBX_BloomingDays#EXO#PremiosMTVMiaw #MTVBRKPOPEXO@weareoneEXO
  Everyone goes on about ticket touts ripping you off. The real rip off is paying £70 for an Arctic Monkeys ticket, 2 weeks after payday, when you don't even know what their new music sounds like. Who just has £70 to spend on a mystery in the middle of the month?

  Music is amazing because, like, it’s created by an artist with their own interpretation of it yet somehow we listen to it and it gives us the strength to get through so many of life’s trivial problems.
  All this new music makes me miss Danielle spin class would have been lit esp with this new Cardi cuz she always had the new songs on her playlist asap right @stephcakes lol

  @King_EST19XX @kansasjws Because it's called a remix and they give props to those who wrote it. I just know if someone did this with mods music you probably wouldn't be too happy.  But like I'm saying, who really knows. All I know is they sound way too similar. Much love

  @vampirecoffee when i'm working out my mind either wanders if there's no music or latches onto whatever it can listen to if there is. that includes the lyrics. that's just how I work.
  also the idea that you can support someone’s music but not the person or their actions is a complete lie. if you listen to their music you’re supporting them. there’s no way around it. if you support an abusive artist, you’re supporting their art AND their abuse.
  Though my birthday is on Friday the 13th, there will be good music that will be coming out that day that I can look forward to.

  @mattmoran_music Lmao “Tuesday thoughts”
  9/ “We should fight back against the encroachment of identity politics into classical music” Yep, let’s start by dismantling the gender/race based power structure of society so quotas won’t be necessary. Until then I’m ok if some talented white guys have to try a little harder.
  @nanaslugdiva I’m harsh. I don’t mess with Moby at all. Too much good, ground-breaking music happened around him for me to appreciate his stuff.

  6/ “To question whether having a gender quota at music festivals is necessarily a great leap forward is to reveal yourself a terrific misogynist if you are a man or else simply naïve if you are a woman.”Actually yeah, kinda. Except anyone can be a misogynist, not just men.
  @actualflirting If you're iffy on them whatsoever it seems like a straight no to me. You'll surely never truly be comfortable having your music on there. Bandcamp is a good instant consume platform these days, just not as ubiquitous I suppose.
  5/ “A good start would be”...”throwing out the ukuleles and exposing all children to the glories of classical music.”If you think ukulele can’t be glorious you need to expand your playlist. Classical music is not superior to other music, just different.

  I love you @HJBROKENHEARTS because you are non compliant, non co-operative with people who treat you unfairly. You don’t pander to men. You don’t  want people to say nothing about your music but instead comment ‘she is just so nice’. Fuck that weak shit. Speak up sister xxx
