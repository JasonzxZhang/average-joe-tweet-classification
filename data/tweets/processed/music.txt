 To me, their records are still great. But I also recognize how crucial they were to introducing me to not only a certain style of music - jangly, power-pop leaning things - but also to specific artists I wouldn't expect.
 The books are fine, as is some of my music, bc Google drive...But the rest of my music...and my series...and my movies...
 @Brittany_207 this can also be a curse when the music is associated with a memory or a person or pace you care to forget or maybe somebody you miss *tear falls**everybody hurts by rem plays softly in the background*
 There is one thing I know to be true and that is that Harry Styles has the innate ability to bring joy and happiness when you least expect it and may need it most. His music, sense of humour, compassion and kindness are sometimes the exact cure for whatever ails you.  pic.twitter.com/jgwFULtkXV

 I like Autechre, but I listen to them because I learn things from them. They're experts at what they do, and as someone else who makes music I want to understand them. That's about where it ends. I have no emotional attachment to anything Autechre have done.
 i just wanna know why my apple music has only been shuffling Drake, PND and A boogie. Tryna tell me something???
 secondly, this is the same old criticism of Kid A: that Radiohead made Aphex Twin and Autechre into pop music. To which I would say, yes. No shit. That's why it's great!
 #Firstplay: "Wave Music X - Trumpets for Dick Higgins" by Charlie Morrow on BBC Radio 6 Music (#BBC6Music)
