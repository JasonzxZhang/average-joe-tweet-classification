 @NichBoy Managing time can be tough. But my gaming time is also my social time. I live in VIC and my closest friends and brother live in NSW. It's how we catch up. It's how we socialize. So I take that into consideration when balancing game time and life time.

 @andrewhuang @ClarkeAfterDark Practically all TV's support 60 fps. Most TV shows are aired in 60 frames a second (often using interpolation to send twice as many half sized frames). Gaming consoles, old as new, run a lot of games in 60 fps when hooked up to a TV. Heck, even CRT TV's display at 60 fps!
 @aerincreer @dclark_74 In fact, people probably, on average, spend more time playing meaningless games of 2k than they do looking up things about astrology considering how gaming culture operates and I know several boys who play games every day for several hours at a time.

 @DestinLegarie I have no interest in buying a PC for gaming. I love my Xbox console and honestly I like that I don't have issues where One update could stop me from playing a game until the company patches it. I also do not like the toxic community of the PC. I'll stick with console.

And not to mention they really don't have time to test their updates since they do them weekly.

 @OwenJones84 @HologramGarden @sparklecreek I'd have to agree that twitter is a cesspit of hatred. I've seen a side of people on here I never imagined existed. I've used many forums, msn, faceparty, MySpace... only online gaming and Facebook come close to the absolute hatred and anger displayed on Twitter.
 @kurosixx Not gaming but I witnessed YouTube elitism once where this guy put down every YouTuber he knew during a stream.

 @ColdDeath @JamesAdamWynne You can't compare this to having Gamespot, the biggest website at the time, in such a huge scandal. I'm not saying gaming journalism is 100% perfect, but it's quite clear that the big, relevant websites are a lot better and don't blindly promote shitty games from big publishers.

 @NewsHour @JudyWoodruff We have seen probably hundreds of tv spots about coding, but an actual "code" is never presented. What does "code" look like? What products perform as a result of code? People hear coding as part of 'gaming' but that's a turn-off to serious minded adults being asked to fund it.

 So my brother asks for a gaming pad, and he gets it. I ask for merch to remember the concert by, and my parents tell me it's too expensive lol ok

 @katiesgamecrner Nothing wrng with that, i usually go with jamaican Veg Pasties and bourbon and coke in bed and books, especially after a long gaming night.
 @htcvive @Jack_Septic_Eye YEESSSS!!!! BOSS GAMING TO THE NEXT LEVEL
 Watching the replay of @CohhCarnage's GoW3 playthrough from this morning makes this afternoon's gaming work (photo editing, article writing, and the first ergonomics grab bag answer column!) MUCH more fun.

 Whereas my two brothers will never leave their room, always playing online games and SURPRISE they're never relied on OR made out to be lazy. I tried online gaming (Guitar Hero) with ONE friend and of course Dad still needed me to get him beer from the fridge.
 @Retro_Q_Gaming I’ve been watching someone on Twitch play it and… it doesn’t look fun at all.
 Same thing goes for community people, artists, newcomers or veterans of the gaming world! I welcome you!
