 @NichBoy Managing time can be tough. But my gaming time is also my social time. I live in VIC and my closest friends and brother live in NSW. It's how we catch up. It's how we socialize. So I take that into consideration when balancing game time and life time.

 @andrewhuang @ClarkeAfterDark Practically all TV's support 60 fps. Most TV shows are aired in 60 frames a second (often using interpolation to send twice as many half sized frames). Gaming consoles, old as new, run a lot of games in 60 fps when hooked up to a TV. Heck, even CRT TV's display at 60 fps!
 @aerincreer @dclark_74 In fact, people probably, on average, spend more time playing meaningless games of 2k than they do looking up things about astrology considering how gaming culture operates and I know several boys who play games every day for several hours at a time.

 @DestinLegarie I have no interest in buying a PC for gaming. I love my Xbox console and honestly I like that I don't have issues where One update could stop me from playing a game until the company patches it. I also do not like the toxic community of the PC. I'll stick with console.

And not to mention they really don't have time to test their updates since they do them weekly.

 @OwenJones84 @HologramGarden @sparklecreek I'd have to agree that twitter is a cesspit of hatred. I've seen a side of people on here I never imagined existed. I've used many forums, msn, faceparty, MySpace... only online gaming and Facebook come close to the absolute hatred and anger displayed on Twitter.
 @kurosixx Not gaming but I witnessed YouTube elitism once where this guy put down every YouTuber he knew during a stream.

 @ColdDeath @JamesAdamWynne You can't compare this to having Gamespot, the biggest website at the time, in such a huge scandal. I'm not saying gaming journalism is 100% perfect, but it's quite clear that the big, relevant websites are a lot better and don't blindly promote shitty games from big publishers.

 @NewsHour @JudyWoodruff We have seen probably hundreds of tv spots about coding, but an actual "code" is never presented. What does "code" look like? What products perform as a result of code? People hear coding as part of 'gaming' but that's a turn-off to serious minded adults being asked to fund it.

 @GavinFree Poor diet, too much stress/late night gaming, not enough physical activity maybe? Go climb a mountain, that'll make you sleep at night. Or maybe your brain's just too hyperactive and needs something to put it to sleep. History lessons at school seem most effective there.

 @FinKone1 @BikeManStream If we are talking about a dual setup for stream data being delivered via satellite and gaming via his current connection that might be a bit more reasonable. Geostationary satellite connectivity can be impact severely by weather conditions as well. Again would need to research.
 Every so often you hear of a notable gaming enthusiast saying something like collecting retro games isn’t fun anymore. While I understand that hobbies come and go, I recommend that if anyone ever feels that way, they look inward at their collection.

 I'll admit, there is one polarizing trait I have with video games and gaming writing. I like everything! There are few games I don't like. However, that also is a trait I need to fix. When to be critical but constructive if something. If a game is bad, it's bad.

 @Fons_SSB I imagine smash switch will have a release date at e3 / the invitational. The 2018 in the trailer means we should expect more reasonably soon. Gaming generations already has mad switches because of pokken so I think a tourney like TBH8 would be fine in that regard.
