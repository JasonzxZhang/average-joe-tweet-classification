  @NichBoy Managing time can be tough. But my gaming time is also my social time. I live in VIC and my closest friends and brother live in NSW. It's how we catch up. It's how we socialize. So I take that into consideration when balancing game time and life time.

  @IGN @novaseat I'm both and I can tell you first hand that it's not that. RPG gamers have a great taste of gaming and know which games are amazing. But usually, the majority of 1st or 3rd person shooter gamers don't even know what different is and never experiment with different games.

  @tiptoehappiness Not because I can't commit but because I have a life outside of gaming and my kids are not going to miss their weekend sport or whatever on a week night just because someone says that their mother has to participate in a raid. I'm a filthy casual when it comes to MMOs.

  @andrewhuang @ClarkeAfterDark Practically all TV's support 60 fps. Most TV shows are aired in 60 frames a second (often using interpolation to send twice as many half sized frames). Gaming consoles, old as new, run a lot of games in 60 fps when hooked up to a TV. Heck, even CRT TV's display at 60 fps!
  @aerincreer @dclark_74 In fact, people probably, on average, spend more time playing meaningless games of 2k than they do looking up things about astrology considering how gaming culture operates and I know several boys who play games every day for several hours at a time.

  @DestinLegarie I have no interest in buying a PC for gaming. I love my Xbox console and honestly I like that I don't have issues where One update could stop me from playing a game until the company patches it. I also do not like the toxic community of the PC. I'll stick with console.

And not to mention they really don't have time to test their updates since they do them weekly.

  @notearssh3d Even tho I really don’t wanna quit gaming, it’s not forever, and I tbh just need a break... everyday gaming feels not even fun anymore... with all the raging and stuff, I’m just not having fun with YouTube because I’m not enjoying playing games...
  @RobbieDuncanOL Haven't been gaming as much as usual but I'm definitely going to have to check them out.
  The only thing I prefer about console gaming is the fact you can sit on your bed, and play without sitting uncomfortably at a desk. I know that can also be done if I just hook up a controller, but meh.

  I miss the days when I was comfortable enough to run/play RPGs online. Over the last like 5-10 years I've become less and less comfortable with it. The idea of gaming in person terrifies me. Online just intimidates me. Just lost something over the years. Dunno.

  @FuhDellSon I hate when a company releases a game and already has DLC planned. What happened to finished games on launch? It's all shitty developers and even shittier companies turning mainstream gaming into mobile gaming and their shitty P2W/MTX model

  @OwenJones84 @HologramGarden @sparklecreek I'd have to agree that twitter is a cesspit of hatred. I've seen a side of people on here I never imagined existed. I've used many forums, msn, faceparty, MySpace... only online gaming and Facebook come close to the absolute hatred and anger displayed on Twitter.

  @NewsHour @JudyWoodruff We have seen probably hundreds of tv spots about coding, but an actual "code" is never presented. What does "code" look like? What products perform as a result of code?

  @MandyleePlays It all comes down to preference, I wanted the best gaming platform, with the most bang for buck, with the most flexibility, and I am a sucker for tinkering, so chose PC. Others choose based on ease of choice, games library (as exclusives matter to some) as well as the target demo

  7. You’re a positive force that loves all things cute and gaming so it’s no wonder you’re an Overwatch fan too! Yet I feel like I don’t know you as a person. Gonna have to change that and pay more attention to our tweets!
  @aerincreer @Soundsbysoy @JESSrelax @Eye_Kyu @godhateskris @sophia57910384 @mattdkerr @mayowa4321 @hancockonetwo Some do and some don't. And some people definitely take video gaming, 2k included, as a way of life. Some people on this thread even say they think of it as a job opportunity. They're not as different as you'd think. You're just ignorant of one and not the other, that's all.

  One day I’ll break the record for the longest gaming marathon
  Last couple of months (including CES) I've been watching the television (and gaming monitor) market, and it's fascinating. But, similarly to everything else, the giant quality of life problems have been solved. Slowly, that innovation is trickling down to the budget TV's.

  I'll admit, there is one polarizing trait I have with video games and gaming writing. I like everything! There are few games I don't like. However, that also is a trait I need to fix. When to be critical but constructive if something. If a game is bad, it's bad.

  @FoxBusiness @williamsidopise America didn't love Trump... barely 1/4 of the country supports him and voted for him. He won by gaming the EC, with lots of help from fake news aimed specifically at the proudly ignorant MAGA klan with their pure hatred and spite. Trump is a joke by any measure.

  @BeastFireTimdog I suggested something like this a long time ago. Iit’s a no brainer for the consumer but why would they? It would be $180/yr as is so I really doubt they’ll take a 44% hit to bring it down to $100 if they don’t have to. It’s still the best value proposition currently in gaming

  If you dont know anything about gaming just dont simply make a statement to the others about being noob while he\she using good peripheral such as steel series, razer, logitech, and much more. Just mind your own business. Everyone has to start somewhere. Bye 
  @verdict4489 @erret84 @Puertorock77_ @MarkWoodland76 Yup. Google, Facebook, and Amazon want bigger stakes in the Console / PC gaming market. They are what the incumbents MS and Sony will have to deal with in the medium term.
  Idk why this narrow minded people think when someone buy some good peripheral for gaming and secara tak langsung dia mesti or wajib pro in any games. Come on dude, we buy all those things becoz of its comfort and ergonomic for gaming.

  Sex in Hollywood is fine, but in videogames it's a fucking sin.Sex work is a fine job but grid girls and booth babes are being objectified.Women in gaming should be treated equal but you're not allowed to treat them like you would other gamers when playing vs them. #clownworld

  @verdict4489 @MarkWoodland76 @FreeJAC Wrong. If it was dead then all future games wouls still be playable on PS4 but they won’t. Sony will cut off PS4 and the only place to play Sony exclusives will be on PS5 or better put, next gen console. BC doesn’t change the system of generational gaming.

  @jasonschreier Streaming is definitely the way gaming is moving. Cloud based processing with 4K streamed back over hi-speed broadband. The console then becomes nothing more than a conduit and local storage.
  @SpawnWaveMedia 946 reviews on something that dropped a few hours ago... It's likely they're being trolled early and hard. I'm not surprised, especially with the way PC gaming culture is all about trolling and trying to bring everything down, no matter how good something is.

  Second, the increased gaming time does not appear to be uniform across this age range. Instead, it looks like men born after 1985 have tended to delay the dropoff in gaming a bit further into their 20s.

  @CandiceLikesYou I am in a constant state of fear of being ridiculed for liking games that sometimes have bad reviews or deemed inferior in the gaming community. It's really difficult to shake this feeling a lot of the time.

  @TristanACooper @cascade_gaming_ Overwatch is far, far from the first serious eSport league: FGC and Pen & Paper/Card/Board community has had a hold on that since the early 90's.They've been doing this since D2 and Star/Warcraft, however, and Blizzard is way better than most in pushing competitive money.

  @PLAYERUNKNOWN @PUBG This must be the dumbest update in the history of gaming updates. Now I understand why other battle royale games are taking the lead when you were the innovator. I guess show your opponent the ropes, and he’ll lead the way!

  @t8styham @StonzySecond @GundamIsHere @Under_Ach1ever @Dealer_Gaming @Colteastwood @Nicholas_Vesely @CalebOrman Actually no, GPU wise the closest thing would be an RX 580.The RX 580 uses the same GPU architecture as the PS4 Pro/Xbox One X and it has 6.2 teraflops.It can even go higher with an overclock.
  @BigEdJr I'll look into that. On a micro level, I can tell you that you can probably skip the effort with her, as she is a staunch opponent of any gaming expansion in the state.

  @KazuCrash_ Oh, there totally are! Gaming history is very incremental; much of it is based on building off of previous attempts.TBH I tend to take more issue with the specific usage of the phrase "aging badly" than anything; I feel it's a case of misaimed criticism and it's a bit lazy.

  the problems with mainstream gaming journalism, at least in many cases, is that it's either stagnant and bland and/or it caters to AAA devs and gamers in an attempt to seem palatable. this is why 8.5 is practically a fucking meme. it's the magic number.

  @ben_silverman So true. The same happens with companies who lose parts of their historical record because stories about them or products are erased. Super important to solve the problem for digital games as well. Gaming memories die on obsolete consoles and platforms.

  Gaming can very much be an escape from the stresses of life. It can be a moment to disconnect and decompress; simply letting yourself clear your mind. Additionally, certain games can be a fun way to connect and compete with your friends, adding to a social aspect. #dmad18

  @Colteastwood @HXCGamingEvents PlayStation. Because it's first & foremost just a gaming console. The quality of the exclusive games are a cut above Xbox. Have both X & Pro, but PS is my preferred platform now. Always been Xbox but feel this gen they've lost their way.

  Gaming doesn’t impact my life but I know people that participate in online gaming and have invested a ton of time & money on games since their friends play and because it’s popular. #dmad18
  thankful i have some crazy connections that rly don't care about competitive gaming whatsoever.
  Gaming doesn't really have a big impact on my life. I was never one to play video games much, except wii or candy crush when I was younger. I have seen gaming play a big role in others lives to the point of staying up all night or skipping class. #dmad18

  Gaming does impact my life in some aspects. Most of my friends play certain games all the time. I play video games with my friends sometimes but I would classify myself as a gamer. #dmad18
  Gaming can like influence the way you live your life and make your decisions. My parents wouldn't let me play GTA in my early years probably since they saw it could have a long term negative effect on young people. #dmad18

  Gaming impacts our life because people beomce so invested in the game they can't stop playing the game. They drop everything else because they are so addicted to the game and want to keep playing in chance of winning the whole game  #dmad18
  #dmad18 Not that im much of a gammer BUT I feel that gaming has the ability to bring people together and bond over a common goal (winning the game or whatever), I also like that it takes your mind off of "real life" for a few hours
  Gaming impacts my life because i have a little brother that is obsessed and i constantly have to fight him to watch tv instead of watching him play 2K. #dmad18
  I'm not into gaming, therefore, it doesn't really have an impact on my life. However, I am aware that it does have a profound effect on the lives of others and consumes much of their time.  #dmad18
  #AirdropWow! One of the most interesting ICO's over several months in a gaming industry!  
  Gaming does not impact my life directly as I do not play any games myself. However gaming affects my life indirectly as others around me are consumed by games and are losing their social skills in person and instead are focusing on socializing solely online #dmad18
  Gaming serves as a nice distraction in my personal life. Sometimes I will bide my time with them when things get too serious or I need a break. People can get addicted to them or make significant money playing or selling them, but probably not me. #dmad18
  I don't think gaming impacts my life today. I do not play games on my phone or video games often, but I did play the Kim Kardashian game when it first came out, and it was something that became a part of my social life because me and my friends would talk about it #dmad18

  Gaming impacts my life in a very minimal way. The only time I really play video games is if I am bored on my phone. For example, when I am on the plane, with nothing else to do, traveling to and from school, I play games such as 2048 or Temple Run to pass the time.   #dmad18
  @Patjeuh_070 You'll be back to gaming in no time.

  @ST31NM4N Everyone has teabagged someone in an online game, I fail to believe otherwise  I find campers to be more annoying than the teabaggers. If someone teabags me, I take that as a challenge to kill them and do it back. There's bigger problems in online gaming than teabagging.

  @andrewhuang Yeah, most YouTube videos really don't need to be 60fps, my old computer couldn't even handle it so I'd have to watch at a lower resolution sometimes since you couldn't disable 60fps and still have it be in HD. It makes sense for gaming content though

  @andrewhuang Theres a reason people say "24 FPS look more cinematic". Idk what it is, but movies in cinemas look perfectly fine in 24/30 FPS, while being weird to look at with 60 FPS. But for gaming/lets plays anything under 60 (or even 144fps) seems super slow and sluggish

  @xNever_Landx My dude @Griffin_Gaming why on earth would you RT this trash? We don’t all own PS4s, or want to. GoW looks fantastic, but i’m not paying 460$ for one game. FOHDid I make a mistake following you? Maybe I should’ve done a little more research than just watching a YT vid. 
  @Bowerss8 Yep I agree. I just feel like they’re making it way too easy to “win” a game. I remember it took me a solid 3 months to ever win a game of H1Z1, it was the best feeling I’ve ever had in Gaming. In my first 3 games I won in Fortnite. It’s just catering to kids.
  @redlianak Teabagging is dumb, but complaining about gettin' teabagged is dumber, IMO. It's pretty much the gaming equivalent of doing like, a ring with your thumb and index finger and shouting "GOTTEM" at whoever looks inside it.

  It will take even longer to undo or change the mindset of what is now the vast majority. Gaming is no longer niche, it's not small or isolated, but the people that have circulated these attitudes were never reprimanded or faced any real consequence and that's where we are now.

  South Korea is using ipv4 internet connection with 28.6 mbps. They are ranked as first in the fastest internet in Asia (that's why they are able to lead gaming leagues). They also have a massive database storage, and most of these are using masked subnets.

  @scottythered It doesn't help that there are some hobbies that are considered to be "time wasters". And the line can be so weird too - reading isn't necessarily a time waster (if you're reading the "right" books) but gaming almost always is. Why can't we just let people do things they enjoy?

  @AmandaFarough @0Knaomi It’s not rocket science. Gaming isn’t all fun. It’s work. It’s a job. When you are at work, you act accordingly. When you’re home being an ass to your friends, teabag away. The fact so many don’t understand the difference there is astounding.

  "You should learn to play along and not offend anyone in our preferred political sphere if you want any coverage from us."This is why gaming journalism is considered the lowest form of the craft.
  @jwlkr74 You're assuming failure. If an ORG invests $300k (5 player salaries and gaming house) and they get $700k in ad revenue, is that a failure? If an ORG invests $300k, and gets $300k back is that failure?

  @AndroidAuth The point is that they need it in markets where their price is too expensive. For example, in India the launch price is ₹73k for Pixel 2 XL. In the price you can get a low end gaming laptop. So it didn't sell enough in India. Especially given that the phone was basic.

  @ebilmeeki Absolutely :) and that's the beauty of gaming, there's so many choices and so many doors to open.  I used to love competitive gaming in my youth -- still kinda do, play poker fairly regularly too -- but the quiet pleasantness of Ni No Kuni 2 just made the hours melt away, yanno?

  @AlphaLackey I think any game that requires competition can bring out the best and/or worst in people. Some take it more seriously than others. I rarely play MMOs and when I do, I try to avoid being the tank or healer. They get so much shit. But gaming will always be my home & favorite hobby.
  @Ryasarous Is sitting down gaming and eating food part of the program :P
  Oh no! I'm kinda half and half about this, it's become infamous for this game yet its a good choice, it's given me either slow games or instant kills and always gets overpopulated! What do you guys think? #FortniteBattleRoyale #TiltedTowers #gaming   …
  @ShimmerwindIsle Indeed. Play a little Dungeon World or any other PbtA game and it’ll open up a whole new gaming GM didactic of player idea inclusion. Play a little FFG Star Wars or Genesys RPG and practice the concept of “failing forward”.

  @Futterish @SteveTheLich @WormholeWars I never heard about this game before but now i'll check it out.

PS: IT'S NOT REAL!
  Damn I love Fire Emblem...and Xenoblade...and Kirby...and all those other Nintendo things. Screw it, all those non-Nintendo games are great too. Gaming is great.

  @ShepCommandr Yeah. I even laughed at them for a minute, but the whole "Ready One Player" jokes are just so cruel. Seeing the hate the game is getting on YouTube is also disappointing.But hey, gaming communities are largely a hellscape.

  @qwertyuiopthepi In my opinion, this is nothing new. Haven't children always been like this? It's hard to grasp the importance of money when you have everything given to you. Blaming mobile gaming seems like a bit of a stretch to me. it's just a product of the naivety of childhood.

  @countingthetoll @UncleShackler I've honestly never had that problem. Been gaming since Atari, PC gaming since Ultima Online. I'm into shooters, survival horror, sandbox, etc. That's why I speak up about this shit because it's really not the problem they make it out to be. Most don't even know I'm female.
  @virginmedia 1. Received a phone call today someone from a call centre telling me they can send an engineer to set up my router for gaming, Netflix streaming etc. Which is what I thought I was paying for anyway, she then goes on to say this service is called 'homeworks' and it's £9.99 a month
  @UncleShackler @ebilmeeki The reason I joined GG was because I tried to have honest dialogue with both Anita & McInJosh and got blocked. I realized it was not about gaming or gamers but narrative. If they listened to real female gamers they'd have nothing to outrage about. It's depressing.

  That said, I'm aware of the backlash for both the book and the movie that came about as a result of Gamergate. We still have a lot of work to do to make gaming and geek culture safe and enjoyable for everyone, not just men and those who want to rain on the parade.
  Well, when they get busy in real life, everyone ends up moving on from gaming.
  and before the "oh they're just kids" argument comes into play, a LOT of athletes start their pro careers as teens and yet somehow don't drop slurs in front of massive audiences.it just says a lot about overwatch's culture and gaming culture at-large that this is the norm

  @DarrinBarnett1 @bennyglish @RitaPanahi @Simon_Breheny @TroyBramston @rowandean @SkyNewsAust @PMOnAir I’m all for organisations to host gaming events for a cause/ charity etc. Games likes COD or Battlefield are very mainstream & bring in a lot of people. But in the context of a RSL having a gaming event with COD. Not the smartest call, but whom am I to judge.

  @cokelogic Affirmative action is shit. There just so happens to be more men interested in working in the video gaming department than women. There is no sexism, racism, genderism, whateverisms.

  @masonicgamer With the advent of the XBOX ONE, I’m less and less impressed with PC gaming. I bought my PC for the power  & graphics, but now what I like about PC gaming most, by far, is simply the variety. But I definitely spend a lot of time on the “getting the PC to work properly” metagame!

  @AmandaFarough @GamerGeek_174 @KeeksMacgeeks @BazLaFours I guess its about a general attitude towards sex, masculinity and feminity.

  @shznkhn @BlackPanthaaYT @UpfrontBowl62 You're wrong to think there aren't people who wouldn't overpay for content in paid games *cough COD*. I advise you do more research.

  Crazy to think of how esports, gaming, and online content creation has evolved and how it will continue to grow and develop over the next few years, decades even, at such a rapid rate.
  Super insane to see where @Ninja and gaming entertainment will go over the next few years decades even. "Online fame" will be a thing of the past, and it will simply be the same thing as "traditional fame". That's huge from so many angles including business and the scale of games
  Still amazes me how @Ninja plays with traditional celebrities and is responsible for turning gaming, streaming, and content creation into something that can be deemed as "traditionally famous". @Twitch is also a huge help with that, as is @YouTube.

  @F4CEpa1m Just looking at it for a secondary device to my main PC & a bit of network management when out & about. Maybe some very light gaming. Microsoft has a deal for £275 off the i5/128 so thinking I might go for that :D was slightly nervous about only 4gb ram but think it will do.

  @CosmiCatArt Yeah, that was the issue I noticed with most gaming content, which, again, was why I chose to stress variety from the start.It's really frustrating how few people show up for variety, though, I understand why that would be an issue if you were making a living off of it.

  @werenotwizards @BoardGameCrate My first exposure to “modern” gaming as a hobby was Ticket Ride which is now considered by many to be a modern classic. I’ve expanded my collection quite a bit now, but Ticket to Ride is my most requested game when I visit my folks and will always be special to me.

  @VGHangover @GeekadeKris The magic the gathering community get together at events. And would I like to hear gaming podcasts to do the same. I see it as if everyone is having fun. We have less to worry about.
  @NerdHousePlays @lady_dkat What lady said they are 100+ hour games, and you said you wanted to marathon them. Now a marathon is usually a continuous playthrough and playing non-stop is not good when playing through the Persona games, thats like a week straight of non-stop gaming.

  Who said the gaming industry do not create a conducive environment for female gamers? Just saw two guys spread out their entire inventory as she casually picked up an 8x zoom on Pubg. Meanwhile, I passed away yearning for a medical kit. @PUBG Kudos! #MeToo
  I feel like I wouldn’t have really had the motivation to skip a night of gaming to hit up the gym a year or two ago. I’ve dropped a lot of mental dead weight since then but now I’m focused on dropping real weight.

  @lemon_lag Just take a break dude if it's getting to you that much. Whenever I feel like this I like to play rpgs to take my mind off of the bad. There are several other games that aren't Splatoon and other activities outside of gaming. Take a break and come back with a fresh mindset.

  @kevthulhu I had an account for ages and barely used it until I realized so many gaming people use it centrally. It's probably my central place now too.
  @jovie2fresh I really respected you and your gaming opinion Jovawne.... but you really just jumped out the window with this comment. I honestly expected better from you. GTA V is a cult classic that starts off lit with mission one and explodes

  If you’re into black metal or into gaming, The Rageaholic is a recommended YouTube channel from me. Just steer clear of his political rants if you’re democratic or despise Trump. That’s a major caveat with watching his stuff since he may turn people off on occasion.
  If I learned anything in the past two years of gaming. Chances are if the developer says “dark souls of” then it’s probably a crappy game

  @shznkhn @BlackPanthaaYT @UpfrontBowl62 You clearly don't understand how F2P works. Calling people stupid for applying logic is foolish. It's a F2P PVP / PvE experience that overcharges for cosmetics which IS NOT needed. You don't have to buy them to get a full gaming experience like a traditional DLC. No comparison.
  @t8styham Out of all gaming platforms you can get, Xbox One is the absolute worst.The weakest, no games, biggest rip-off in paid online...At least Nintendo's is cheap (although PC is free), AND it's portable, AND it has one free online game, and at least PS4 SORT OF gives you something.

  @witchergame @lobrocop Usually I would definitely recommend playing them in order but they're long games and I feel like your stream focuses more on interaction than gaming (which is fine). You'd have to make an effort to get immersed otherwise it could turn out to be just another game that lost you.

If your metric for a healthy genre is how many click-whores streaming the game I'd say you've gotten caught up in the 'like-share-follow' facade of gaming personalities/leagues. Games survive by playerbase interest, nothing more.

  @YugSTAR I understand this clarification but it still feels like a huge clash from the prevailing culture at PAX. Nothing happens in a vacuum. Exclusivity is NOT what gaming culture needs, esp not at the biggest gaming convention in Australia.

  @TheSpartanShow Gaming should relieve stress as opposed to adding to it. One reason I don't stream as much as I used to is because gaming is "me time," and sometimes broadcasting defeats the purpose and just adds in pressure, though I'm sure it's different for everyone.

  @motdraw1 @DionDoes is my favorite gamer. Brings the real definition of community with his sports channel, gaming channel, and daily dose which really makes us feel like fam. I've been subbed since October 2015 making his channels the ones I've followed longer than anyone else. Best on YT.
  @CaffreyFan I don't work for or get any kickback from my ISP but @Coextro has been excellent. 3 of us, Netflix, work from home, gaming, etc. Excellent customer service and uptime. I think we are on dsl 25 plan. Internet only (no phone or cable) unlimited use and under $50 per month.
  I've had a headache the past two days due and it's affecting my #FarCry5 gaming. I can recall finishing two missions.One in Holland Valley eliminating all the truck convoy's and one in Hendane River where you hack the terminal at the gas station. Otherwise, it's just a blur!

  @sbjsbd @BenFischerSBJ @esportsobserved I just hope the future of PC games isn't hurt by young gamers playing mobile games more and more. Consoles will probably be fine. But the barrier to entry (cost) of PC gaming, especially graphics-intensive games like Counter-Strike, might lead to a drop-off in player-/viewership.

  @AmandaFarough @TheBardess @lung_yean Nor am I, just think it’s a stretch to say that a well known joke in video games (that could have no way been a surprise or shock if they were a gaming journalist) is akin to sexual assault which some people are claiming
  @Activision @ATVIAssist Are you in competition with @EA for the worst, most redundant anti cheat by game developers? Just had a game of WW2. reminds me why i don't play it or BF1 anymore. At least @Ubisoft are doing something in RS Siege. Gaming is a bit of a joke the way it is

  @Griffin_Gaming Now the story, they have Dan Slott on the writing team, he is one the worst Spider Man comic writers of all time, he likes to deconstruct Spidey from an ideological standpoint, and make him a bitch for characters like Mockingbird, rather than doing what fans want like Pete and MJ
  This is really impressive, however it will only reinforce the trend towards micro transactions dominating gaming, which dilutes the gaming experience in my opinion.   …

  @Radical_Heights @IMBALDGUY @therealcliffyb @Entrr_Username @Kalyx_triaD Lets be fair here, fighting games are an old and refined genre, it's been around since the dawn of gaming. It's passed its fad days decades ago, now people know what does and doesn't work.Survival games were a fad series, now people understand what works.
  @Griffin_Gaming And brought down Darkseid with a bullet, not to mention having his back healed with Magic after Bane broke it. The arkham series matches Batmans illogical logic that no other superhero games have yet matched in the context of their source material. Thus Spider-Man PS4.

  @Griffin_Gaming I have been reading comics since Ultimate Alliance, I wouldn’t be the fan of Marvel I am today without that game and the way it didn’t shy away from comic book lore, but something was still missing, the gameplay still didn’t match up with how the comics explained their powers.
  The scary thing is seeing the gaming community determined to justify anything OWL players do. They are determined to reject anything that’s remotely “PC” in nature. Even if it’s the law.

  @OMGitsAliA @M_E_Gaming @FutureLinkzy Please refrain from bashing console players. Some of us don’t have the money to buy a gaming pc, or simply prefer console because its not as competitive.

  I feel as the biggest problem in gaming atm is content.We get updates and new DLC every 3-4 months. When most players go through a game in one Month. If developers can meet the demand and pump out quality content every 2 months and great updates. I think games will be better off

All of the game you hype up for, are MADE on the PC. Of course, PC gaming has a higher install base. Mostly because PC's have an actual purpose.

  Every AAA title since 2006 has been “visually impressive.” Ultra hi-res textures and high polygon counts are mainstays. If you are a “gaming news” purveyor, do NOT tout a game as visually impressive in 2018.

  @totominya Since this mobo has three or four x16 slots, I can have two graphics cards running side by side.Not SLI, useless for gaming, but: More monitor outs. Which is good because screen number four ONLY has VGA. So it's either an adaptor or an old card for legacy support.

  @Windows Running various pieces of assistive technology software and other applications at once is best done on a gaming PC. I've been running Windows on a 2010 Mac Pro,  but am tired of a company who ignore feedback / "web wide" negativity on one issue, and ask for then ignore feedback.
  Anyway, we obviously must protect precious female gaming journalists from the harsh realities of competitive play. My suggestion is to relegate them to reviewing only hidden object games.

  @NepentheZ Bro, you're really being too hard on yourself lately, not just in your ability to game but about yourself, it's easy for me to sit here & be like "it'll be okay" but truth be told life is hard, gaming is just a hobby and when fifa started making me sad, I quit or took a break.

  @Trey_Partin I'd totally be into a dating app aimed at gamers, really hard to find someone interested in both games and me.Gaming is one of my pillars so I think I'd find it a bit hard to be in a relationship with someone who didn't at least have an interest in the hobby.

  @KiwiArkangel Hi, who is this journalist you speak of? Respectfully, I’d love chat with them if they exist. But I don’t think a gaming journalist ever actually claimed it was us. It’s just a rumor because in our gameplay video you see me (a dev) get teabagged.
  Gaming remains the primary reason for sales of VR devices and this is unlikely to change over the next few years.

  I remember a video where you artificially inflated the price of a gaming pc to make the xbox1x seem like a far cheaper deal. This is before the mining craze hit.You also said a 1070 was the minimum to run froza at 4k this was not true a 1060 runs it at 4k at 60fps.   …

  @FortniteGame I'm still getting the constant freezes in battle royale. GTX 1050TI gaming x with ryzen 5 1600. Its getting unplayable when it occurs 2-3 times a game.
  I enjoy seeing your gaming tweets. I am in awe of the skill that you must possess to be able to obtain the platinums that you do. You’re a good sport and always encouraging and helping others! That definitely doesn’t go unnoticed!
  It's never too early to teach your children about disappointment and loss. That's why I've introduced mine to classic 8 bit gaming.

  @Wyld It's also worth noting that some systems have audio issues with NVENC still. I don't know what the variables are there.And of course, it doesn't work well at all unless you're doing this with a dedicated streaming PC; trying to NVENC on the gaming PC is a recipe for 2fps.

  @IGN Not my cup of tea, graphics look a little Fortnitish, that’s not my cup of tea either, I’m clearly not the zeitgeist when it comes to gaming. Nothing original here.

  @YouTube @DreamcastGuy That was our first interaction and I just want to put that out there. Developers are proving that if you want a game on a platform bad enough, optimizations under the hood of the software can be made. PC gaming is all about raw power. Console gaming is about software optimization
  @MatPiscatella @silva_ruancarlo @Boothy4444 Leveling up and upgrading shit is pretty much a standard these day in gaming, so those basic game features don’t make it an rpg. I don’t understand why I’m not allowed to not like a PS4 exclusive, sure I’ll try it out when it comes out but I’m not hyped nor impressed.
  @Prime_Gaming_YT @Noalh As long as you don’t troll is by playing infinite warfare, Yes I would like it.

  @YouTube @DreamcastGuy Remember when I was saying things like “As a computer technician who builds and optimizes computers for maximum gaming potential everyday, I disagree that developers will find more power in the switch’s chip?” Since then, Doom, Rocket League, and Wolfenstein proved me wrong.
  @jlbeeh @jrmydklnhns Yeah, I sometimes find myself realizing that the time I spend working at my full time job really intrudes on my gaming. On the other hand, it does pay me so I can pay for food, shelter, and dice.

  @British_Bastard @thewaether Instead of telling people to change their sense of humor to one you approve of, you could just stop talking to them, and talk to people whose sense of humor you do like. There are ample tools to do this in online gaming (muting a player or blocking them)
  In a curious time where labels are courting reaction channels and even using them in album marketing, but also content claiming against them in the YouTube backend. Feels like where gaming was a few years ago before the publishers realised the potential.

  @AmandaFarough @Rmc09z @Thomas100273 Oh she has every right to speak about it, I'd never deny someone that.

I think it's irresponsible to possibly hurt the game or the dev over an offense that is part of the culture.

  @Remiderp lol tea bagging is just part of gaming culture. idk if that's good or bad, but it's weird she doesn't know it's totally not a gender thing
  I just really have a lot of questions about what role these cultural curators whether it's music or gaming are actually doing for ANYONE but blowing smoke up their own asses.  Probably stop dealing with them altogether in the future, less time writing, more time producing.
    My first actual gaming video I'm so excited to make more!
  gaming and anime too of course

  @philatticus Now we tweeting about gaming systems. Hahaha see this is what social media does. It sucks you into the "shit talking" then somehow subjects get changed and you're almost friends and before you know it you're fucking each other's girlfriends and drinking beers every weekend.
  Sometimes I wonder if people actually pay attention while gaming... And "listen" to what characters even talk about. Nena at Duat for example.

  @AmandaFarough @SteveCKerr @ObiCynKenobi @Chupacaubrey @OldManKaidan @Futterish @aTonyTotebag Great irony of it all is that being a "girl gamer" is shittier now than it was 5 years ago because the perception of women in gaming is that we're all either "lolrandom!" or these hypersensitive rainbowhairs who want someone to die in the street cause they offended them.
  Thank you @Animuncula for the RT! I found out that it can be a good idea to pay attention to our brain chemicals at the gaming table.
  Cross play gaming is awesome, especially for us PC players  but seriously for the player base. If you love playing on Xbox but all your friends are on PS4 you don't have to compromise to play. And if you don't want a disadvantage it should be an option in the menu to restrict.

It's still voice and sometimes video. It also has a decent safety net due to not having to worry about physical proximity to the people you're interacting with.

  As of late, I've been way more focused on mobile gaming than regular gaming. This is simply because I can move around easily and still be an adult and a father while I have to take care of the younglings at home. Specifically, F/GO has been my go to.

  Two generations ago, the only “screen time” parents worried about was a few television channels. Now, kids have endless cable and online viewing; DVDs, DVRs, and downloads; Internet, gaming, and social-media options beyond counting; and the ability to...   
  From there, I faced the truth that my gaming and alcohol habits were also the result of caring too much what my friends and family thought. I wanted their acceptance, so I lived like them.That shit made me miserable.So I stopped drinking and gaming and started exercising.
  @perfectmanda Yeah how stupid is that? I think they were at some gaming expo showing off a new game or something she died and he had his character teabag hers and she kicked off. It always happens its practically part of it!

  @AmandaFarough @DJuice97 @amis_amai @websupergirl Is context not important to you? In the context of online gaming (something I've been doing since the mid 90s) teabagging is juvenile but it's not offensive to the majority. It's a joke. Its also not something everyone does. Stop turning everything into a crusade.

  @Casey_notCasey @Futterish @ArsVampyre I'm so happy Mike is being outraged for other people and doing everything he can to push what he feels to be virtuous in a world gone mad.

  As it being the greatest thing ever. A game that's sort of like this is OoT. Love the game and understand that it's important in gaming but that isn't enough to make me think it's the greatest game ever. At the time of its release maybe, but at the moment I couldn't say it is.

  Let's talk #videogames.What's a video game, maybe from your childhood or an earlier gaming life, that you wish video game makers would remaster and release for a newer system?

  @OverloadUT I'd agree except YouTube releases troves of data showing their health, even when they don't garner the expected growth with initiatives like YouTube Gaming. The platform as a whole is healthy, and they release plenty of data to back it up.

  Women have a particularly hard time with gaming. It's got a lot better in recent years, but is still a struggle for many to be taken seriously in their careers or as a hobby. I feel like articles of this nature do nothing but make the situation worse.

  Getting "teabagged" or "clam slammed" (whichever you prefer) is the  ULTIMATE sign of disrespect when gaming, regardless of gender or sexual  preference. It's a straight up middle finger to a gamer. You can be  nice & laugh it off, or kick it up another notch with a cooler K.O.

  @fiddlecub @Futterish @texrat I doubt she was actually upset by this and if she was maybe gaming journalism wasn't the best avenue for her. I don't assume women are sensitive, fragile girls that need to be shielded from contreversial acts.
  @ArgonPW I'm missing gaming with you bro!
  I don’t get why people are acting like the recent owl incident is a “gaming community” thing. it’s not. adults taking advantage of minors is everywhere and that’s the issue. acting like it’s only problematic gamer boys ignores that predators can be anyone.

  @AmandaFarough Getting "teabagged" or "clam slammed" (whichever you prefer) is the ULTIMATE sign of disrespect when gaming, regardless of gender or sexual preference. It's a straight up middle finger to a gamer. Now, you can be nice & laugh it off or kick it up another notch with a cooler K.O.

  @CharlesTrippy Take it from someone who works at Best Buy in the gaming section (hey, that’s me!) not really. I recommend just going for the One S. It’s cheaper and does the same stuff as the X just a TINY bit slower.
  @BiggestBiscuit @JoeScheler That can come in the form of increases to current taxes, or in the form of expanded gaming, etc...  Remaining revenue neutral, while continuing to not fund appropriately is a recipe for disaster.

  @FractalDesignNA If talking CLCs then I would do the CPU because I dont like the CLC GPU mounts.Open loop is a harder decision. I find the CPU blocks look nicer, but GPUs can benefit a ton from the extra headroom.So aesthetically I say CPU. For gaming I'd do GPU. Both is better though.

  Just said goodbye to the Playstation 4. It’s been fun, some of the best experiences I’ve had in gaming were on it, but I haven’t played anything on it since new year, and the only game I’m interested in on it is Kingdom Hearts, and I don’t need to play that. It’s spring cleaning.

  @maniadrone There's a huge degree of overlap between those groups, one of the most popular gaming channels in existence is fucking Polygon+ only outlet I know that was vocally against Kingdom Come was Waypoint, other outlets either didn't care or just covered like anything else
  Another reason why I haven't bought a single @Sony product in years. The damn exclusives that only ruin for the end consumer. After expensive DLCs and lootboxes this is the worst part of gaming. Companies and their greed.
