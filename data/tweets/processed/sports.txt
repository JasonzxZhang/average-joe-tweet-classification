  @sahilkapur @BradStone @tictoc Because this is sport, not actual public policy?
  @BrianHD03 Sports are sports man & you just said you would rather see what your team just did for the past 6 yrs then have your team be in the position the the rangers were (in championships) that’s assanine. Doesn’t matter hockey baseball or football.

  @RapSheet @GaroppoloGoat @StephLouiv No moron, he isn't being questioned for his love of football.  That's just the sports media pundits stirring up drama for clicks.  Rosen loves the game and addressed this BS at the combine.  Durability sure, but even Brady missed a season.  Darnold also threw a LOT more picks.
  .@EMUAthletics the decision to drop four sports is a tragic and short-sighted one. Shame on the administration involved in this decision. #SaveEMUSwimAndDive
  Best rivalry in all sports. Yankees Vs Redsucks. Let’s go Yankees!!! #PinstripePride

  @SixersScience @DatDudeRR @lwrncjones 1) sorry I got it from a sports writer just clarifying his thoughts, then I looked it up and realized he was wrong 2) I literally said I agree he is a rookie, that whatever the reason for not playing the point is that he didn’t play
  @DanWolken Maybe because they sensed illegal behavior and no other law-enforcement bothered to sniff it? Let alone the governing body of the sport.

  @TJLett Its not just baseball though, its every sport. People don’t realize how much work athletes put into their careers. If it was easy everybody would do it to make millions of dollars. Some of the criticism is welcome though but there is a line that shouldn’t be crossed.

  @Johnsportslaw Multiple issues here. Besides an obvious monopoly, which I don't believe will hold up in court (said the guy who is always wrong), the league can charge untold millions for the data regardless of how good it is (thinking in-game wagering) and the sports books will have no options

  @Ahmed_1897 @aka_X Sports are about the athletes. Coaches are important but let's not pretend they win the games... they make a difference but not everything. As they say in the #NBA it's a player's league...
  “We play a sport,a game. At the end of the day, that’s all it is, a game. It doesn’t make you any better or any worse than anybody else. So by winning a game, you’re no better. By losing a game, you’re no worse. Keep things in perspective, so we may treat all people equally!”  pic.twitter.com/CfReqkKlWG

You reference others reporters and sources but they don't even have the facts. ie: your recent May/Mac II article. Was surprised to see that kind of coverage on Forbes.

  @DIRECTVNowHelp Unsurprisingly, that doesn't answer the question. This is a local team on a local channel; to my knowledge there is no other MLB streaming rights deal that should be preventing people in the local market from seeing this game (Sox game works fine on NBC Sports Chicago).
  @stan_mugi @PollyMUFC @MrBryanDavies @eevelynctrr @KellyFosters @Rio_F79 @venus_0712 @AmyyyRosee @KickAssCantona @Unitedhere2016 its a team sport my guy. simply put, madrid is miles above barcelona. tonight proved it. and yet, only now in april were barcelona knocked out of a treble winning season. there's your doubt. good try though.

  @BBCSport Salah is brilliant. He's quiet throughout the game and gets 1 chance and he takes it. The sign of a world class player. Fantastic from him and with him in the team Liverpool always have a great chance. #bbcfootball
  @Sportybilly Well said Bill. So important we grow  in  for girls and boys. A great team sport and indoor game.
  @BBCSport I think you’ll find the mother of all comebacks from 3 goals down was achieved by Liverpool in Istanbul when they only had 45 minutes to do it in and no away goal to assist them.

  Jokes on BT Sport 3, Fazio should have been sent off but his yellow wasn't a yellow?... And yes I understand that the 2nd incident should have been a yellow and therefore a second but that would ignore that he shouldn't have been on a yellow in the first place. 2 wrongs and that
  There are a lot of strange things happening in sports right now. I see a lot of underdog action shining through. I suspect that it will continue over the coming months. I'm looking at that Timberwolves-Nuggets game as potential tomorrow but line hasn't yet opened.

  @sportdiversity Yes I often cite it + discuss - the LGBT coaches one, and conditional acceptance? We recently found similar, and some roles within sport are more accepted if LGBT than others - to be published soon hopefully

  It’s nights like these that you realize just how amazing this sport is. Even though I am not a ‘fan’ of any of the teams that played, I felt the energy, emotion, and passion. It’s something we can not take for granted. Cherish these moments and ENJOY THEM!

  What a fucking day of soccer! Liverpool destroy Manchester City 5-1 on aggregate, and Roma make one of the greatest comebacks and win 3-0 after losing 4-1 against Barcelona in the first leg and advance to semis 4-4 on away goals! THIS IS WHY SOCCER IS THE GREATEST SPORT EVER!

  @RETR0MIKEY Bruh when did you start watching this sport ? Liverpool’s getting smoked by real or Bayern next round then you’ll end your season silently in 3rd with no trophies. Callate ahora por favor
  After watching potentially one of the most lackluster performances of a soccer match I’ve ever seen, I will no longer be caring about the sport until the World Cup. Good thing the USA isn’t in it to get my hopes up!

  I was on the train today and someone was listening to 'In the hall of the mountain king' as if it was just the done thing.  They really didn't sport the image of Grieg fan to be honest and I had to check reality in case I was dreaming.
  Just my way of saying that Ohtani right now is great for the sport, even if he does not maintain otherworldly talent and I'm glad the @Angels made the moves necessary to get him. Similar to signing @PujolsFive, this contract was more than just a baseball decision
  @BBCSport Wow... I just wanted to say sorry @anniewallace for asking that time when I tweeted you and said “not to be mean but is this all you post?” It was rude of me to say that iam really sorry x

  @TMZ_Sports He’s talking old man nonsense.
  @Sport_Witness It wasn’t just the goal. It was 0 mins of added on time despite all the yellows and 2 mins spent with TAA replacing the ball. And above all it was frustration at a ref determined to make himself the centre of attention like Ovrebo. Pep was quite restrained in those circumstances

  @BBCSport @dalemccuaig @hirst_robbie @quentinhayes_  a city player kicked the ball at another city player. Because he didn't pass it back and it was an accident Milner would be offside he knew so let it go out....Same applies for Karius. It's very very simple.Either Milner played it deliberate or didn't. Law is same.

  @BBCSport @dalemccuaig @hirst_robbie @quentinhayes_ Lol. Again it's been cleared up on tv. The only way sane is on is if you think Milner plays it deliberately. So you either do or don't. Clearly just deflects off his thigh. This coming from guy who didn't know two defenders have to be behind keeper if he's out...
  @BBCSport Wasn’t even an empty goal, he chipped it over a defender. Very good finish

  @dcmireles @MaaaarisollM However, not all NCAA coaches make millions. The range can be anywhere from $40,000/year to $11 Mill./year respective to the sport, NCAA Division, and coach title. If Coaches on the lower end of the scale get their salary cut, they will barely survive.     
  I know that NASCAR is struggling ratings wise, but this would definitely help the sport, especially at tracks where there are no lights. Even though the sun sets later in the summer, it didn’t stop NASCAR from early starts back then. Why now?
  When is NASCAR gonna go back to 1pm starts? I’ve been a fan for over 15 years, but I’m getting kinda tired of these late starts. Early starts would be good for the sport IMO, because fans don’t have to wait all day for the race to start.

He talks like someone that’s just learning the sport and then in the next breath tells us a great. He’s absolutely past it and is in it for money, not glory or for the good of the sport. There’s no way Haye wins.

  @WaddleandSilvy Why do they even show the strike zone box.  Its simply the most frustrating thing in sports.   50% of the time the ball is nowhere near the box and its called a strike or vice versa.  It was way more enjoyable to just hate the umps calls without now seeing proof

  @MikeConnellyFSA Just read your comment in the NY article.  Kzone is very intrusive and distracting to a ball game.  Baseball is a conversation sport and I’d much rather hear your analysts discuss balls and strikes than watching a pane of glass on the screen full time.
  @BBCSport #bbcfootball Everyone is missing the point regarding the offside. Player IS offside if the ball rebounds off an opponent. Real question is was it a rebound or did Milner play at it?

  @BBCSport Spanish ref combined with a Catalan manager of Man City. Can only see one outcome and it will be in favour of Liverpool. Suspect there'll be a red card or two for Man City as well. Which dipstick at eufa thought it would be a good idea to appoint a Spanish referee for this one.
  LFC players are just looking for fouls. They don’t even care about playing the sport. What the fuck is this?

  @EnginoJuushichi @Skye_pls @TravelingCtrlr The entire goal of esports is to create fans, though. Consumers. In traditional sports you don't see people running out to practice their drills after watching the game, you just see them buying merch. esports is viewer centric, and that's to the detriment of players, the core.

  @BBCSport @david_onechop2 Has to be two defenders mate, it’s just that one is normally the keeper. That being said it should have stood because Milner played it.
  @JElgott Nah. If VAR was used in this game it wouldnt have flowed half as well, and all the excitement and passion would have been totally sucked out of it. VAR is the worst thing thats ever happened to this sport, and needs to stay well away, forever.

  @BBCNews @BBCSport VAR has to be used. Awful decision to disallow goal, came off Milner, can’t be offside
  @BBCSport Milner lifted his leg trying to control the ball, that’s deliberate play. No offiside. Should have been a Sane goal. #bbcfootball
  @BBCSport Pep has a right to be pissed, that was a clear goal. Why the fuck does UEFA have a linesman on the sidelines and edge of the box for too? Useless. Disallowed a perfectly good goal

It’s a very grey area on the goal though because there is parts of the offside rule that aren’t widely known as they don’t often come into play but I don’t know what they are so I am just happy it was disallowed

  @BBCSport @hirst_robbie @dalemccuaig @quentinhayes_ @craiglufc97 @Fi3ld23 Haha what? 
  This game is literally tainted past the point of it being relevant anymore. The referee has been the biggest factor in this game by a country mile and it’s a disgrace to the sport that VAR still isn’t in the UCL.
  @BBCSport @kiam06 @Jamleech92 Clear foul on vvd meant first goal shouldn't have stood, 1-0 is fair
  @ericburkley Yeah for the most part, but there are some plays where human senses are just not capable of making that call, and that shouldn't be left to a judgment call.  Soccer is the only sport that matters that doesn't have it.

  Well that was hardly a straight forward first half.  Can’t help but think that if van Dijk goes down there, a free kick is given. He stays on his feet, so it’s not. All those people who wonder why diving exists in this sport, there’s your answer.

  In fact many shooters come from either political families or business level rich families. Which isn't the issue but I never saw a gareeb bachhi trying to make it big in shooting other than a few exceptions here & there (miniscule). Same with golf, polo & all other elite sports.
  Having briefly worked in the #Olympic sport sphere, met many Indian shooters who prepare for big games. Yeah, credit where it's due, they work hard. But then again one can only access elite sports like shooting if you have 'connections'.
  As a kid, I found #shooting sports very glamorous. As I grew older, I started looking at them rather differently. So someone fires some bullets on a target board and we laud them. What is this obsession with guns?

  @BBCSport Sane was not even close to be offside position. And Sterling might have dived in the past but he should at least got one penalty. Liverp**l brought the double-decker and UEFA to the Etihad.
  Also Steve Mcmanaman is an absolute plant pot, clearly doesn’t know offside rule, even said it came off Milner, who employs these jokers on BT Sport?

  @Halodux Haha I know he doesn't give a shit about hockey. That's why I tagged him lol.I still remember a couple years back, he was complaining about hockey games ending in ties, which hasn't happened since 2004  Shows how much he knows about the sport.
  @MLB @coolassang I don't know why but it feels like all major sports are having huge issues with consistency from officiating.  I feel like MLB could cut out 99% of these issues with a computerized strikezone.  Plus I want to see a manager come out of a dugout and yell at a computer

  @BostonUprising @Floridians_48 @undeadarmy47 @TheCopyDawg @SoulPsyMag Sure, but I'm sure it's nice to root for a team that is "representing" your town. I'll admit, I'm not sure why they decided to name teams after cities, but it's probably to bridge the gap between "real sports" and "esports" a bit to make it more palatable for general audiences.

  I really do hate being a Buffalo sports fan sometimes. We got a bad football roster who is not in a draft position to get a QB. Basically no offensive line or receivers. The assistant captain of our last place hockey team doesn’t even like hockey anymore.

  @SouthCoastPiper I use @TailwindUK and think it’s great. If sports products like this work for you then make the most of it. They are max nutrition is small volumes. It’s v personal though as some like savoury not sweet / real food vs products- so what works for u is key. Experiment is best tip.
  @SkySportsNews @Octreos Ok that’s why I’m saying sky sports you good 
  @TurnerSportsEJ @3ManFront @gossettbrandon I agree. An NBA segment would be great too. Whether people understand it or not though, esports are growing incredibly fast. ESPN, Turner, and other sports media outlets are already catching on. I thought @WJOX945 might like to get in on the scene too.

  @AdamSchefter @samalipour football is still considered America’s top sport? Ever since they blackballed @Kaepernick7 for a silent protest that follows America’s own constitution, I doubt the @NFL is still the “top” sport. If it is, it won’t be for long.

  Ball sport playoffs have no business in racing. In Super Bowl all other teams arent on field too affecting outcome. One race finale where leading car of 4 takes all makes reg season useless. Stop hating on big pts lead after 35 races. If a guy is above 60 pts GIVE HIM TITLE

  @AnonyMousey @goonerbuzz @ThamtheTerrible @tuba_lisham 1) Did Khabib ever say he does it due to the dire situation in Chechnya, even though he's Dagestani, or is this an assumption? 2) The comparison lacks for me, cos *assuming* that this context of the sport is haraam, it's not from the kaba'ir, unlike what Playboy is/was known for.

  That being said, they also have one of the best fan bases' in baseball. They pull 3 million fans every year with ease, and they're loud. They always put down the Angels, and the shit just bothers me. That's sports I guess tho.
  @ginamizell @nuggets @Chazon_15 There legitimately is no excuse for complaining about the peanuts it costs to get a subscription to follow your favorite sports team.  You waste more money daily on unnecessary expenditures than it would cost you to have a monthly sub.  Quit complaining.
  Already reached this point w/the Reds. Sure they could give a shit less I no longer come to 8-10 games/yr, & I don't give a shit either. I don't mind losing, I do mind blatant negligence and entitlement of I'm smarter than the fan. 0 accountability in sports font offices.
  #Browns fans will rationalize & rally around whichever QB is selected, it truly is why they're some of the best fans in sports. But as I've gotten older, shit just isn't that important anymore. These ego driven "football guys" continue to make unintelligent decisions, so be it.

  Just as a follow up, ESPN hardly allows a good take on air anyways so why have people talk about it in depth? If I want in depth, I just listen to local sports radio. I always watched ESPN to get a ton of highlights. It’s simple, but I don’t get why they don’t try that.

But, then ad blockers were invented, and the revenue from ads isn't what it once was.  So, the model is shifting once more.

  @nataliapetrzela Interesting! There is a history of using sports stars to lead it -- Stan Musial led it after Wilkinson. FloJo was involved at one point. And according to Wikipedia, so was Arnold Schwarzenegger! But yea, I think recently it has been more professionalized.
  @RickRMehta @JB_Goldstein @bill_bonker lol. The trans policy for competitive sports is open-shut for me. There's some room for consideration on issues like score-keeping for 5 year old kiddy soccer. As a parent I cater the amount of objectivity applied with the kid sports based on their personalities/individual needs.
  Torture to me is having to play any sports video game no accelerated clock max time in each quarter or 9 innings no quick count. Just kill me

  @politico Wait. What? Local media doesn't delve far into national issues, it's mostly births, deaths and local sports/politics. So, if Trump won in places with decline in local media, wouldn't the people depend more upon national media?

  @matthewsyed great podcast this week. Right at the end, “is it the same as doping?” For me, yes it is. It was premeditated cheating in pro sport. Should be/could be 2 years. See Justin Gatlin for example of when the punishment isn’t enough for cheating.

  Guardiola: "In this sport you have bad moments. In the last two games we've had those moments and the opposition has scored goals. We're a team who has conceded the fewest goals and fewest chances for other teams. We have to get back to that."
