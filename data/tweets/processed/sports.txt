 @DanWolken @BradenShamo @taggartfsu The college sports media is full of nerds who don't understand big boy concepts like money laundering, and in most cases know nothing about the sports they cover (like Dan at the Winter Olympics).It's a wasteland. Few solid writers. Most are just fans that want a sideline pass.

 @HARRISFAULKNER @FoxNews What gender pay gap? People pay for what they want. They want to see the big boys play sports, so they attend their games more than women. Movies with leading men tend to gross more at the box office. etc, etc.
