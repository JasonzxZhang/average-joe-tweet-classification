 @DanWolken @BradenShamo @taggartfsu The college sports media is full of nerds who don't understand big boy concepts like money laundering, and in most cases know nothing about the sports they cover (like Dan at the Winter Olympics).It's a wasteland. Few solid writers. Most are just fans that want a sideline pass.

 @HARRISFAULKNER @FoxNews What gender pay gap? People pay for what they want. They want to see the big boys play sports, so they attend their games more than women. Movies with leading men tend to gross more at the box office. etc, etc.

 @danikaplowman yeah some matches can be like that but most of them today aren’t. the moves really do hurt, they just have to do them a certain way so that they don’t get injured (which still happens a lot). it’s sports entertainment, they’re not actually supposed to injure opponents
 @NoLore @amykishek The reason there has been such a large response to this tragedy, is because the “hockey” community is a large one nationally/internationally and all those ppl can easily relate. Anyone who has belonged to (or has kids)  a sports team can easily place themselves in this horror.

 Mid-State Classic with some of my favorites!! #softball #tennessee #gbo @ Ridley Sports Complex…   
 @CMPunk @AJKirsch I was there, everyone was happy, and celebrating the greatest sport in the world. You're the only asshole for thinking you can tell people how to enjoy THEIR experience. It's not yours and if you don't like that atmosphere you are free to simply not watch raw.
 Dating a lot of people in a short period of time should be an Olympic sport.

 @BigBird1182 @CharlieHustleKY @Nati_Sports There's also been a lot of backlash from his Red Sox & Blue Jays tenures about his in-game management. Personally I like Farrell but none of that should be discounted, it's definitely interesting.
 I love luxury sport sedans like my car and bimmers and Mercedes but damn if I happen to find a cheap as balls 80's/90's Ford Fiesta I'mma buy it.
 Turned to watch the Roma game after the second Liverpool goal and I could feel the intensity from just watching. There’s no way Barcelona was scoring late. Fuck I love this sport!!

 @Adam_Klug Blazer fans might say Sam Bowie was a big sports tragedy
 This is true across sports. (Generally) Offensive players get used to being smaller and less strong. They never really get comfortable with being slower
 @TMZ_Sports Oh thats right, he was going to be the first NBA player in history not to cheat.

 Based in sheer ability and strength of opposition, did Roma have a better chance of qualifying than City? You have 'international sports journalist' on your bio but you accuse me of pride because I stated what was a general consensus? Amazing   …

 @krqegarate Let’s start with football and basketball. Coaches salaries are insane for the returns, and other sports are more deserving like baseball, beach volleyball and cross country.
 @Matt_Sharman @DuncanCastles @azz_3 @kopking12345a1 Agreed. Much like the commentary on BT sport, only the last 10 minutes did they start saying anything decent about Liverpool.
