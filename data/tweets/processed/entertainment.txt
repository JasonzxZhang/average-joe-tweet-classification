 While the character is used mainly as a form of entertainment, viewers can still take away an unrealistic expectation of what autism really looks like.
 The television show "Big Bang Theory" features the common stereotype, used as comedic entertainment. Sheldon Cooper is a theoretical physicist who has many of the common stereotypical symptoms of autism, shows a lack of understanding in social situations, and emotion in general.
 I feel so sorry for people who don't like football. It's the greatest form of entertainment in the world.

 Porn is NOT harmless entertainment. Pornography is the objectification and prostitution of human beings. Porn is "committing adultery in your heart" in the words of Christ. Porn is poison. It sabotages the sacredness of sex and it harms all who consume it. I know from experience.

 Fox entertainment is a hotbed of “victim culture”. Listen to what they say, specially, how they say it. Its pure unadulterated victim culture. Its the delusional psychosis where you perceive everyone else’s successes as coming at your own or someone else’s expense. Pathetic.   …

 @Darren_Mooney @NardiViews See, for me entertainment is all tied to the characters. You can create the most amazing action you want, but if I don't care about about the characters or if I'm not clear why people are fighting one another, then I just can't be entertained.

 so I just rewatched some YoI and it hit me how much queer content there is now. music, shows, movies, books - mainstream entertainment being casually and unapologetically queer. we didn't have that just 10yrs ago, when I was a teen, but it's here now and that makes me happy-cry

It’s sweet-natured reality entertainment, but not without its, shall we say, “spirited” disagreements and passion-driven cast members.  Love ‘em, one and all.

 @Official_ITFC @cidersuspect @Liampufc1996 And how many supporters at any club can you say want their team to play boring football grinding out a point to bottom half teams every week? It's not to much promotion that's the problem it's the lack of entertainment. He's boring and old fashioned. Too many fans leaving.
