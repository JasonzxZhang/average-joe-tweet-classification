 @WBH_Politics But we need the trains to become a real city, apparently.
 @brycetache The problem is a lot of people (I've noticed it's particularly prevalent among right-leaning folks) treat politics like sports - they want their 'team' to win and love seeing the other 'team' lose. But that's super harmful because it's not a game - it's a country.

 @ThomasWictor @jswriter65 I try to explain this to friends and they just don't get it. What I struggle with is the question of whether they are engaging in social engineering based on the politics of the outlets ownership or just going after confirmation bias for clicks.

 All politics aside: 1. Mueller is a good and honest man who has served our country repeatedly;  2.  No individual is above the law;  3. I hope no indictments come out of Mueller’s investigation but we need the truth more than we need an Executive branch overreaching its authority
 @SenFeinstein @cakeis_not_alie You missed the point. I’m pretty damn far from a Republican. As I mentioned in my statement, parties change. People change. Anyone who has succeeded in politics enough to get to the US Senate is a shit bag who has probably let a woman drown in a river or been a KKK member.

 @TheJordanRachel @SoundTheTrump @DannyWo78375369 Thanks Danny, I have never seen war, only on YouTube or tv. You of all people know. This is not bout people, it's about politics. I have "played" war in the Dutch military, drafted at 19 y old. You know shit that age. I believed in NATO, USA, good and bad. It's all bad.
 @selectedwisdom No one's ever really given @POTUS credit or respect for being an intelligent man. Understanding certain legal principles, even the simple ones, go right over his head. Same goes with economics and politics. Myopic understanding of the world.
 @chrislhayes Maybe,if you supported the efforts of those that want money out of politics,the incentive to substantly fellate both parties for that sweet campaign commercial cash wouldn't exist. They can't WATCH partisanal porn, if it isn't broadcast.

 @RyanAFournier @TrumpStudents I was not in favor of the last walk out and I'm not in favor of this one.  Adults have to stop standing behind children to push political agendas. Especially when it means pulling them out of school. 100% of their focus needs to be on education not politics.
 @bschlenker The memes are already great indeed! But I'll always go for sourcedata over commentary ESPECIALLY when it comes to politics.

 @realDonaldTrump @jonkarl @Berger960 @georgiainafrica @Alfred8909 @SlightedSoul @JacobusCuesix @JJussely okay jennifer please, I am just very curious about your politics trump and the attorney general are saying no one is looking into hillary. there was a previous investigation for year and half (longer than the trump 1 so far) it found nothing. I want to know why are u not paying
 I'm no fan of FB but not because they have a targeted ads platform. Anyone with half a brain knows that data about their online persona is being used to push them ads, and to scapegoat FB on this issue is just misguided. Attack the disease: corrupt politics and ignorance.
 @JustinTrudeau @Norm_Farrell @cruise_peter That whole king/leader/I make the decisions thing? it's all an act. That's what politics has become. Theatrics.
 Pep has lost as many home games this week than Jose has in his entire United career. But please tell me more about Catalonian politics 
 #Leadership"Our voice, and our vote, should be heard when everything that's being voted on affects us. We work, support our communities, and pay taxes, and deserve to have a say on our future and have an influence on politics." - Brother Tre'Von, 17, Junior Mentor at LPTM
 @TrollywoodOffl @KabilanVai @ImUltimate2 @muthushiv @senthilsailor Don't mix politics into cricket,wow. Why it was mixed for Pak cricketers? Such rules only for Sanghis?
 @joshscampbell We can only hope right now.
 @TomSteyer No he hasnt and you're as ignorant as they come. You dont get to impeach someone just because you dont like them or dont agree with their politics. The American people voted him into office. He won, get over it.
 @AlanLevinovitz In the fields that touch politics, in particular, those methods seem to find "answers" about conservatives that are no better than "I assumed what I wanted to prove", and are in some ways more pernicious, because arguments are met with "But science!"
 Labor has to incorporate MORE educated working-class people into its parliamentary team...this is the future for governance...citizen politics.   …
 Got our politics write up on Monday and one of my friends just went and said she’s not coming in awee shit 
 Low-key seeing all this stuff with #politics from both sides is just giving me one thought and one thought only. Y'all a bunch of children in suits pretending to care about the public's interests. Y'all want a better world? Get to know one another.  pic.twitter.com/xA0tikTZXD
 @ACLU @JoyAnnReid @SuppressThis @gobluespokane They ARE, ask any Asian thats 1rst or second generation Korean,Chinese,Japanese etc what they think of liberals, and liberal politics
 I’m afraid to look it’s so believable — mining colony wage workers exploited by life-threatening conditions; oligarchs control politics, law enforcement; living quarters are cramped; only misfits can save us, if we don’t die while they are trying.   …
 “I will soon participate as a contestant” – 2Baba Admits Interest in Nigerian Politics   
 @JimTurn30433019 Not a liberal. I don’t deal with party politics. I make up my mind issue by issue. Sometimes I wonder which side the snowflakes come from though. Left or right?
 @thehill He must be high again 
 @CBSNews @po407 Keep corruption out of politics
 @charlieaable @JoyAnnReid Disagree. Personally, I think he had the opportunity to heal a lot of things, but went another route.  He’s as bigoted and human as many others on both sides of politics.  We all need to do more and be better on both sides of all issues.
 My classmates where extremely engaged about Alaskan history, politics, tribes, and all the information I presented related to language. These where my resources to reach out to/work with.  pic.twitter.com/q6PpOxswgv
 13/ The irony is that while Harris keeps using the rhetoric of “science” to describe his own position, and the rhetoric of “politics” to talk about Klein’s, it is Klein who is being more scientific and Harris who is being more political.
 @Vote4Grimm Unfortunately politics gets involved in order to make it seem like its the only way things can be done right.
 @RoseanneOnABC @Jorge60188 @insprationseekr @robotdanceparty Nope dont support that.What I thought was some of the jokes were funny on roseann. And the writers were very careful to give it to both sides not favor one.The following week, no politics,  ep. about parenting which was funny. Didn’t expect to be attacked 
 Forget politics. Prof. Alan Dershowitz @AlanDersh on Trump’s team is a potential game changer here. Mans sure knows how to win unpopular criminal cases.
 @bainjal You speak the same language as that of your boss @ArvindKejriwal . TDP, AIADMK and Congress disrupting the house were easily ignored? Also this is a protest against Congress's disruptive politics.
 @RonPaul That will never happen as long as people continue to be sheep led by identity politics and misinformation
 America needs a complete political overhaul. #politics

There are millions of youngsters who don't believe in identity politics, feminism, big government, higher taxes, anti-re productive rights, anti immigration of Latinos and muslims, PC culture,, regulated economies and social programs
 @MissingKids @jlwesterfield I would never give a child a phone or Internet connection. Their brain needs to develop in a 3D environment among relationships with living, breathing people in the real world. If it weren't for politics, I'd go back offline in a hot second.
 @NancyPelosi Elections coming time to firm up our "identity politics"... I the data was correctly collard we would find no gap.. but then what would the pussy hats whine about ??
 Politics aside, @SenJohnKennedy continues to show his ability to question witnesses in front of committee hearings he's in better than most I've seen. #Zuckerbergtestimony
 @suddeneternity you have to understand ,we are a big country who are very into politics...I think. This idiot trump is affecting the world ,and screwing the middle class of the US we are concerned . To say the least. Trump is and always was a shady    he is our leader. Sucks
 @JulianeMeyerK @HamzehKarkhi We call that boiler room politics where the real political bosses operate out of. It is all about getting their cut of the pie.
 @TheLeadCNN @PamelaBrownCNN @jaketapper Buckle up
 @PoliticsBroward If you look at yesterday's video of Sheriff Al Lamberti he confirmed that this is indeed standard operating procedure not only here in Broward County but on a national basis!   …
 The question would more be why make a movie on this embarrassing chapter in GTA politics?   …
