  Good, decapitate the regime and "cause chaos" in the areas under their control. Let them fall to the wolves as the rest of Syria fell to the wolves. There are no vacuums in domestic politics. It is the international system which enforces perpetual chaos.

  All politics aside: 1. Mueller is a good and honest man who has served our country repeatedly;  2.  No individual is above the law;  3. I hope no indictments come out of Mueller’s investigation but we need the truth more than we need an Executive branch overreaching its authority

  @phdemclub @TeamPelosi Nancy you’ve been in politics for decades-Surely if your aim was to improve neighborhoods you would have had an impact by now. I think your commitment is mainly to self preservation and bringing more and more divisive identity politics to the table.
  Everything popular is soy AF.Boring wouldn't be so popular if the average wasn't so low.Try to have a lit convo, in person, I dare you.  Sports, Politics, Mythology, work stuff and fear.  That's the average repertoire.  Too little retrospective application, impersonal.
  @jkenney Maybe you should stick to Alberta politics... Is this your idea of doing everything to get it built.. or just to stand on the side and trudeau bash and notley bash at nauseam... Yeah that's what makes a leader.  Your like a school yard bully... Grow the f*ck up.
  I’ll bet that the Clinton Crime Organization is lawyering up and circling the wagons up in CT right now. They have to be thinking there next with the IG appointment.  Everyone in politics is now fair game with what is happening with Trump. #FairGamePoliticalInvestigations  …
  @MichelleRempel @AndrewScheer @Joyuslyfly @mustangmadd @johangreg @Chuckw12 @DianeMariePosts I think calling her dedicated as a MP for 7 years in response to her being called treasonous isn’t beatifying her at all.It’s simply saying you can argue her politics (as I frequently do) without calling her names

  @FDRLST @FrankLuntz Reality is not your Twitter verse echo chamber. You magnify individuals or small groups of the opposition. I honesty believe the average man just wants to live and let live, and doesn't follow politics at all. Hence out low voting % compared to our population.
  @VanessaL43 @HoeCake83Backup @TexSR_Tanner1 That sounds like a ponzi scheme for voters. If you want change find a candidate that supports term limits. Get behind it. Hopefully we’ll have term limits and no more career politicians. If you want to change politics IT TAKES EFFORT AND VOTING.
  @facebook @FoxNews 4/10/18 mark sugarberg my replies are in response to what I think are dirty politics, I’m nowhere near fake news fox news is, I only reply to those who have hidden agendas specially in regards to the TROLL-LOVER in the WH, I use the same style when I was w/fb.....
  @sherryontopp please watch this video. I had some respect for you some time ago. Along with me, many-many people got to see who you really are. You sold your soul while you we supposed to play a crucial role. Neither sardar, nor asardaar. Shame. #Politics

  @BenFoldi Fair enough.
  @davidsirota @Shaun_Girk We act like it’s impossible to change the party, but the Dem party today is to the right of voters. Course they are- they’re addicted to the money and to staying in power. That is the extent of their party politics. People have to stop talking as tho it’s impossible to shift.
  @JTM_YVA @FrankJManrique3 @OctopusMask Let's see how it plays out... and not the least, what Trump will have to say about the raid. It's in the first place about Trump rather than about the lawyer... he's just a pawn in the great but nasty game of politics.

  @selectedwisdom No one's ever really given @POTUS credit or respect for being an intelligent man. Understanding certain legal principles, even the simple ones, go right over his head. Same goes with economics and politics. Myopic understanding of the world.

  @RyanAFournier @TrumpStudents I was not in favor of the last walk out and I'm not in favor of this one.  Adults have to stop standing behind children to push political agendas. Especially when it means pulling them out of school. 100% of their focus needs to be on education not politics.
  @bschlenker The memes are already great indeed! But I'll always go for sourcedata over commentary ESPECIALLY when it comes to politics.
  18. Kids shouldn’t be used in politics to push an agenda. It’s sick and wrong in my opinion because they should enjoy LIFE, not worry about pleasing adults who are using them for their own advantage.

  @realDonaldTrump I don't think it's a Witch Hunt. I think you got into politics without knowing why you were doing and surrounded yourself with a bunch of greedy horrible people that thought they could take advantage in you.

  @KyleOrl I think for the partisans, yes. For non-voters, I'd imagine a lot of it comes from a tendency to view all politics as intractably corrupt.
  @CNN @withoutbravado The deal is that he is being used as a pawn in the chess game of politics. When his handlers have no other use for him he will he tossed out like an empty box of corn flakes. His message is being negated by oversaturation. Still didn't insult you though.
  @cmclymer Brilliant thread. Politics isn’t a seasonal game, unfortunately. Good people MUST stay informed, vote, and act.

  @voxdotcom Silicon Valley has a unique problem. The same people who use Facebook, also use YouTube, Twitter, Snapchat etc. There are competitors, everyone just so happens to be a customer for all these companies.
  You’re missing out if you haven’t taken a look at my blog post from yesterday - all about   
  So-- I guess this is a long way of saying-- I don't want Pence either, but to save us from nuclear Armageddon, I could be convinced- AFTER the midterms. /END
  He will never be removed from office (do you really think 2/3 of a GOP controlled senate votes to remove him from office), but he could be pushed out and a weakened, and hopefully compromised by the Mueller investigation, Pence will be a lame duck/ 16
  What do I want? Investigations and revelations that weaken Trump & embolden some within his party to constrain him- but not remove him. Then, tarred by their own weakness and enabling behavior, they can be voted out in 2018. With a Dem. House, we can initiate impeachment. /15
  So- clearly- the sooner he is out of office, the better. And yet, the sooner that happens, the stronger Pence's position becomes which long term is also dangerous for all of the things and people I care about. /14
  Which leaves me torn. Every day Trump is in office erodes our standing in the world, undermines our democratic institutions, and violates basic standards of decency. Each day also poses a threat to our physical security as that lunatic is armed with nukes and twitter. /13
  I worry that a Pence presidency would prove an effective barrier against a #BlueTsunami (which is ironic given that he doesn't believe in climate change.) /12
  Republicans who are currently willing to vote against trump because his erratic behavior is too much for them to stomach, will be able to vote for the genteel racism, misogyny, and voter suppression of the GOP- because it will be in code again. /11
  If Pence somehow became president before the midterms, that would bad. If the election turns partly on a collective disgust with Trump (including among more "moderate" Republicans)- a Pence presidency lets them off the hook. /10
  But of course- Trump is the symptom, not the disease. I worry what Pence will be able to do because too many people will feel relieved - like they don't NEED to pay attention anymore. And when that happens the rest of their radical agenda goes into effect. /9
  @SarahChampionMP @julietomo64 @Nigel_Farage @BalcombeGill @mayaminty @jojojoheeley @drrobmoody @AndrewAtter @4BritainFuture @tony_waltho Nice. Loses the argument so resorts to childish insults. Have a nice rest of your sad midlife crisis and enjoy seeing people continue to reject your regressive leftist politics all over the developed world. Most of the European youth are right wing. You are a fossil
  If Trump is forced out (not sure I see how that happens- but if it did...), I worry that some of that energy will fade. Yes- the hard core left will remain angry and engaged. But I fear moderates will go back to their lives- feeling satisfied that they removed the cancer. /8
  One of the only silver linings of the last 16 months has been the emergence of a resistance- of real activism. Donald trump is such a repugnant human being who flagrantly violates decency at every turn that it is easy to mobilize people against him./7
  No- the real problem with Pence is that he looks so much better than Trump. He looks like a grown up- sure a moralizing smarmy one. But he looks the part of a politicians  and I worry about people relaxing. /6
  I'm not worried that Pence will sell favors to foreign governments in exchange for preferential deals for his business (selling moral  Christian outrage and bios of bunnies seems a kind of niche market) or violate the emolument clause every time he breathes. /5
  I also have no fear that he will tweet insults at world leaders, demand a military parade, or force me to have more uncomfortable conversations about porn stars (but I will have to explain the ickiness of why he calls his wife mother) /4
  Russia vetoes a US-led resolution at the UN security council to create a commission to investigate Syria's nerve gas attack
  And the truth is that Pence has the benefit of not being a malignant narcissist with impulse control issues. He's not going to tweet us into WWIII and he probably wouldn't pursue a trade war with China either. /3
  This might be the most true tweet that I’ve seen as I watch this more and more  …
  @Cernovich They can be technologically deficient yet they can excel at war. War is not the same as knowing technology. Politics is politics, War is war, Technology is technology. Have a general view of all sides but excel at one or two or three.

  9/ “We should fight back against the encroachment of identity politics into classical music” Yep, let’s start by dismantling the gender/race based power structure of society so quotas won’t be necessary. Until then I’m ok if some talented white guys have to try a little harder.
  1/ Where to start?How about with the truly asinine idea that identity politics is somehow new: so 100s of years of the oppression of female and POC voices in classical music (and elsewhere) isn’t identity politics? Ok, got it.   …
  @davidhogg111 @Ryan_Deitsch @randyb359 Also, do we know the timeline of when they adopted the second dog?  It seems like there was quite a bit of time spent avoiding the question--long enough to adopt the second "very needy" dog? That let's him claim Reagan wasn't just for politics....? Just a thought...

  @samalipour So, other QBs that have come before Rosen weren’t or aren’t well informed? Weren’t bold because they were dedicated to the game and didn’t run their mouths about social issues or politics? Is that the gist of your article or I am misreading your tweet?

  @PressSec You, Sarah Sanders, are one of the most morally disgusting citizens in American at this current moment. Your job is to inform the public, and yet all you do is lie and spin. You are a failure of humanity and a disgrace to American politics.

  @notevengabbytbh @DariaButGay @FillOaks @moleculesofyou I hope all the rose accounts see who they are agreeing with.
  @cchukudebelu @DoubleEph It is exactly what they need. You think any political lieutenant waiting to work from the ward level to NASS or some juicy state or federal agency cares for some brainy private sector type who is interested in politics. Nope. This is exactly what the status quo wants.

  @morrowfcs @PastorDScott @HolmesCarolyn23 Do you not understand human nature -- thousands of years of civilization and you still don't get it.
