  @sahilkapur @BradStone @tictoc Because this is sport, not actual public policy?
  @BrianHD03 Sports are sports man & you just said you would rather see what your team just did for the past 6 yrs then have your team be in the position the the rangers were (in championships) that’s assanine. Doesn’t matter hockey baseball or football.

  @RapSheet @GaroppoloGoat @StephLouiv No moron, he isn't being questioned for his love of football.  That's just the sports media pundits stirring up drama for clicks.  Rosen loves the game and addressed this BS at the combine.  Durability sure, but even Brady missed a season.  Darnold also threw a LOT more picks.
  .@EMUAthletics the decision to drop four sports is a tragic and short-sighted one. Shame on the administration involved in this decision. #SaveEMUSwimAndDive
  Best rivalry in all sports. Yankees Vs Redsucks. Let’s go Yankees!!! #PinstripePride

  @SixersScience @DatDudeRR @lwrncjones 1) sorry I got it from a sports writer just clarifying his thoughts, then I looked it up and realized he was wrong 2) I literally said I agree he is a rookie, that whatever the reason for not playing the point is that he didn’t play
  @DanWolken Maybe because they sensed illegal behavior and no other law-enforcement bothered to sniff it? Let alone the governing body of the sport.
