  To me, their records are still great. But I also recognize how crucial they were to introducing me to not only a certain style of music - jangly, power-pop leaning things - but also to specific artists I wouldn't expect.
  The books are fine, as is some of my music, bc Google drive...But the rest of my music...and my series...and my movies...
  @Brittany_207 this can also be a curse when the music is associated with a memory or a person or pace you care to forget or maybe somebody you miss *tear falls**everybody hurts by rem plays softly in the background*

  I like Autechre, but I listen to them because I learn things from them. They're experts at what they do, and as someone else who makes music I want to understand them. That's about where it ends. I have no emotional attachment to anything Autechre have done.
  i just wanna know why my apple music has only been shuffling Drake, PND and A boogie. Tryna tell me something???
  secondly, this is the same old criticism of Kid A: that Radiohead made Aphex Twin and Autechre into pop music. To which I would say, yes. No shit. That's why it's great!
  #Firstplay: "Wave Music X - Trumpets for Dick Higgins" by Charlie Morrow on BBC Radio 6 Music (#BBC6Music)

  The last Dr Dre album was massively slept on. It’s such a shame it was just an Apple Music/ITunes release. Nobody got to hear it. Definite 8/10 at least

  Glad I'm not the only person who was pissed off by that Weird Records spiel when they read it. "total immersion in a solipsistic, de-materialised phantom world"- who can honestly say that that doesn't sound awesome and wouldn't want to hear the music from such a realm?   …

  @sqwarlock Amen, just listen to anything that gets your mind or body moving. The best music lovers are the ones that can recommend new stuff off damn near any other song as a source, not the snobbery folk.
  Also, i don’t know why people are sayin he’s bad. I mean that is a style of singing. It’s not bad, it’s just not your taste in music.

  Anyone who even dares come for MJs music. Who do they think they are. It is FACT that Michael was a musical genius. I always think back to his 1993 deposition where he literally explains the process in which he creates every single aspect of music in his head. A genius.

  Last thing I'm gonna say: There's nothing to actively promote. Queen Miss You is retired. She's done and over and not coming back. To be productive as a fan while he's working on his album, stream his music instead of whining to his official UA acting like you're a PR agent.

  @YKIGS @Edith83674755 That's one single you're talking about. Every artist has a weak single in their career. But Ciara had multiple weak singles beyond "Go Girl" and that just killed her.
