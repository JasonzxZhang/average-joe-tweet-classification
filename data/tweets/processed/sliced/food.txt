  @thelittleidiot @RancidTarzie People do make it subjective- For example, they will argue that gluten/seitan, olive oil, & veggie burgers are junk.

I wouldn't define that for others

  @tiny_lantern Decision fatigue is a thing.Also, if my lovely wife hadn't offered to make us tuna melts, I'd be dithering in the kitchen right now wondering what the f to make for dinner so that we could have food.All of-which is to say: I can relate to this a LOT. <3

  He purposely destroyed all of it and got it all over. This wasn't digging around for food or anything. We don't keep food in the garbage. He just fucking destroyed it.
  to eat it anyway, and It was a health risk. She repeated "DON'T TOUCH MY SHIT I DON'T CARE." so I said something along the lines of "enjoy moulded food that'll probably kill you, then." and she screamed again saying she would've thrown it out... (9/19)
  and asked where her food had gone. I told her, calmly I might add (We have a recording. I might post a bit of a transcript if I get a hold of it), that I threw it out because it went off. She shouted not to touch her stuff, I explained that she wouldn't have been able (8/19)
  (As a preface; She had left for about a month and a half for one reason or another. She had fresh, open chicken and eggs in the fridge when she left, food that would go off and quickly contaminate anything in proximity to it.)(7.5/19)
  @beardedd_Legend What is with you and posting food today????
  for said lost food, she threw off with "YOU CAN'T TALK TO ME LIKE THAT" despite him asking quite calmly. These were all red flags. Signs, a warning of things to come... Today, it exploded like I've never seen. I've heard people talk of "Psychos" before but... (4/19)

  perhaps it's good to keep in the back of your mind that all of this doesn't make up a series of coincidences. less healthy foods are more convenient and kept at lower prices to target the economically unstable - just capitalism systematically fucking over poor ppl in america
  sure, it's certainly not the healthiest, but it's sustenance. try to get a little kid (of any socioeconomic background) to eat their veggies and tell me how it goes. also important to note that so-called "healthy foods" are much more expensive than the opposite.
  Clean, healthy food delivered to your door. Perfectly measured #macros ensuring your nutrition…   
  so, with parents working comparatively more hours for less money, kids are often left to feed themselves. in this case, you have to look at it logically. hand a kid a pile of produce and expect them to craft a meal? nah. easy mac? cereal? microwavable foods? doable for a six yo!
  ALSO, reports state that those using SNAP benefits do not, in fact, consume proportionally more junk food. thus, all of this controversy is just entitled people feeling a need to dictate the lives of the less fortunate. (pdf 4 ref:   … )
