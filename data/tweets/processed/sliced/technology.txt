  @futuresquares New innovations, new technology, and new discoveries mean that ‘practices’ like medicine, law, and teaching, are constantly evolving. These professions are always changing, and therefore not exact sciences. So, we refer to them as ‘practices.’ Hope this helps!
  @mthornton78 Agreed. There is more technology now than there was when I was in school and even more from when my parents were in school. By informing them of what is out there and why we use it, it can help alleviate some of the confusion before it arises. #GEN2108 #Edchat

  I just get the feeling that social media is using its power to level shame at adults just for using their human rights to be confident about their sexuality, then market it in a way to help others, then use the technology available to reach their audience.

  @MikeMtk63 These crusty, old "adults" of which you speak seem clueless about Facebook and technology in general. At least Zuckerberg understands the tech of a comfy seat.
  @Liron_Segev I don't think that's quite right... The lack of understanding comes from those 80 year old congressman... They were great and knew what was going on 30 years ago... But they just can't keep up with thr technology today... No?
  Is that really Mark Zuckerberg or is it a hologram or robot of some AI technology pretending to be a human?? The software for this robot keeps answering every question beginning every sentence with "Senator..." and has no human engagement of the passion behind the questions.
  The word robot comes from the Czech Robota. This translates into forced labour or work. #technology #fact
  @JoyAnnReid Yes, ageism stings.  I know many , many people in their 70s and up who understand technology and exactly what Facebook has done to its users.
  @swardley Yeah I agree.  All about perception.  If you woudnt post your bank details why would you post your kids and all your other stuff?  I don’t understand the logic, but maybe because I understand technology I’m fortunate.  Just seems like DOH why you surprised...

  Legislation needs to get ahead of technology to stop it from being misused. It's false to assume average Aussies know how much of their data is online and how it can be used to manipulate them. Politics should be about facts to exploiting people's fears without them knowing.
  It is pretty obvious that the majority of Congress has no idea about technology in general and Facebook in particular.   …

  @CNN The Senators clearly have no little understanding of technology.  They struggle to ask intelligent questions. They struggle to understand the answers. They ask brick and mortar questions, and don’t actually allow Zuckerberg to translate and answer.  Facebook 101. Please.
  .@CoryBooker 'I've always seen technology as a way to democratize, but they can also be used as more sophisticated tools to discriminate.' Asks Zuckerberg whether self-certification works.

  Zuckerberg being 'roasted' by the Senates and the Jury was kinda cute. I think the panel lacked a sense of understanding of technology. It was more of a 'go back to 80s' than 'lets find a way out to 2020'.
  #Zuckerberg -- Seems like some of the Senators do not understand the basics of social media technology, value proposition, business model. Many well-intended questions that are sadly wasting an opportunity.
  Did anyone actually expect that Congress would be prepared to ask real questions?  The lack of understanding of simple technology and technology experiences like @facebook is an embarrassment.  It doesn’t bode well for more complex discussions like cybersecurity or blockchain.
  Technologies use to democratize our system but discrimination seems to be the result of the use of the Fakebook tools- ProPublica, housing ads issue, self certify they were not engaging in these practices, yet 2018 lawsuit shows disproportionate discrimination still exists.

  The broader your understanding of the issues that affect (and are affected by) technology, the better equipped you will be to lead. #MeaningfulGrowth #GeniouxMG    via @mitsmr
  As never before, digital technologies require leaders to navigate social contracts among people, between institutions and people, and between governments and institutions. #MeaningfulGrowth #GeniouxMG via @mitsmr
  1. Be a “techno-supporting skeptic.” I often ask executives, “Aside from purely human acts, name an aspect of your life that does not involve digital technology.” There aren’t many.#MeaningfulGrowth #GeniouxMG via @mitsmr
  My recommendation, then, is that every executive adopt a three-pronged strategy for addressing the challenges that accompany today’s digital technologies. #MeaningfulGrowth #GeniouxMG via @mitsmr
  2. Digital technologies augment the capabilities of less skilled people, allowing them to undertake tasks they previously couldn’t. #MeaningfulGrowth #GeniouxMG via @mitsmr
  1. Digital technologies reduce — and in some cases even destroy — the value of the knowledge and skills of elite groups. #MeaningfulGrowth #GeniouxMG via @mitsmr
  Two other distinguishing characteristics of digital technologies also exacerbate ambiguity: #MeaningfulGrowth #GeniouxMG via @mitsmr
  Lots of opportunity here. Surge has just begun. Over $100m in sales in 2017 and poised to go much higher in 2018. Along with explosive growth in USB-C. Power technologies to watch.   …
  Digital Technologies Are Exacerbating AmbiguityI’ve introduced principles in previous columns about the ways digital technologies can exacerbate ambiguity: #MeaningfulGrowth #GeniouxMG via @mitsmr
  Instead, they must respond to ambiguity by harboring healthy skepticism of the digital technologies they champion. #MeaningfulGrowth #GeniouxMG via @mitsmr
  @BV This Bloomberg article as usual is needlessly pessimistic.  The US will win the "trade war" with Communist China.  They dont have the same farming technology as the USA and feeding over one billion people requires the USA as a partner!
  Digital technologies will relentlessly continue to increase the high levels of ambiguity that executives must navigate. Aside from being broadly informed, how should an objective leader decide what to do when faced with such issues? #MeaningfulGrowth #GeniouxMG via @mitsmr

  @BobbyBigWheel Top level military once had testimony in the Senate on terrorism. It was brought up that ISIS was using Bitcoin. The generals and senators got a good laugh that they didn’t understand this crazy new technology stuff. I’m serious.

  2019: No going back on use of technology –INEC   
  This whole hearing with Zuckerberg is embarrassing. The story coming out of today should be how little our country's leaders know about basic technology. And that's a bipartisan criticism.
  @GerberKawasaki yes, steps that will provide the public with (more or some) confidence in the way their data is used. $FB and the technology sector as a whole will come out of this stronger. result will be more trust and bigger margins to support the new and improved platform.

  @zeynep Depressingly, we’re looking at the tail of a comet shooting away from us. Technology & AI are advancing far ahead of the capacity of governments to regulate.Even if they could comprehend what is required.
  While watching #Zuckerbergtestimony i realised leaders who are running their countries do not know how to make their citizen feel safe. Your congress is not less dumber than our indian leaders in terms of technology. #Zuckerberg
  @WGME @KatieWGME well we had our choice of paddles, in schools. and not one school shooting. of course we still had a student body" where everybody had their own cliques but still looked out for each other, its sad kids these days are being politically indoctrinated,dehumanizing technology,-1984  pic.twitter.com/dl8OPpbK6f
  If we have learned anything from this #ZuckerbergTestimony, it's how little these Senators actually know about the technologies they are trying to regulate
