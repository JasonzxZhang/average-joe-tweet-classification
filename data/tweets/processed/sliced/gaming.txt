  @NichBoy Managing time can be tough. But my gaming time is also my social time. I live in VIC and my closest friends and brother live in NSW. It's how we catch up. It's how we socialize. So I take that into consideration when balancing game time and life time.

  @IGN @novaseat I'm both and I can tell you first hand that it's not that. RPG gamers have a great taste of gaming and know which games are amazing. But usually, the majority of 1st or 3rd person shooter gamers don't even know what different is and never experiment with different games.

  @tiptoehappiness Not because I can't commit but because I have a life outside of gaming and my kids are not going to miss their weekend sport or whatever on a week night just because someone says that their mother has to participate in a raid. I'm a filthy casual when it comes to MMOs.

  @andrewhuang @ClarkeAfterDark Practically all TV's support 60 fps. Most TV shows are aired in 60 frames a second (often using interpolation to send twice as many half sized frames). Gaming consoles, old as new, run a lot of games in 60 fps when hooked up to a TV. Heck, even CRT TV's display at 60 fps!
  @aerincreer @dclark_74 In fact, people probably, on average, spend more time playing meaningless games of 2k than they do looking up things about astrology considering how gaming culture operates and I know several boys who play games every day for several hours at a time.

  @DestinLegarie I have no interest in buying a PC for gaming. I love my Xbox console and honestly I like that I don't have issues where One update could stop me from playing a game until the company patches it. I also do not like the toxic community of the PC. I'll stick with console.

And not to mention they really don't have time to test their updates since they do them weekly.

  @notearssh3d Even tho I really don’t wanna quit gaming, it’s not forever, and I tbh just need a break... everyday gaming feels not even fun anymore... with all the raging and stuff, I’m just not having fun with YouTube because I’m not enjoying playing games...
  @RobbieDuncanOL Haven't been gaming as much as usual but I'm definitely going to have to check them out.
  The only thing I prefer about console gaming is the fact you can sit on your bed, and play without sitting uncomfortably at a desk. I know that can also be done if I just hook up a controller, but meh.

  I miss the days when I was comfortable enough to run/play RPGs online. Over the last like 5-10 years I've become less and less comfortable with it. The idea of gaming in person terrifies me. Online just intimidates me. Just lost something over the years. Dunno.

  @FuhDellSon I hate when a company releases a game and already has DLC planned. What happened to finished games on launch? It's all shitty developers and even shittier companies turning mainstream gaming into mobile gaming and their shitty P2W/MTX model

  @OwenJones84 @HologramGarden @sparklecreek I'd have to agree that twitter is a cesspit of hatred. I've seen a side of people on here I never imagined existed. I've used many forums, msn, faceparty, MySpace... only online gaming and Facebook come close to the absolute hatred and anger displayed on Twitter.

  @NewsHour @JudyWoodruff We have seen probably hundreds of tv spots about coding, but an actual "code" is never presented. What does "code" look like? What products perform as a result of code?

  @MandyleePlays It all comes down to preference, I wanted the best gaming platform, with the most bang for buck, with the most flexibility, and I am a sucker for tinkering, so chose PC. Others choose based on ease of choice, games library (as exclusives matter to some) as well as the target demo

  7. You’re a positive force that loves all things cute and gaming so it’s no wonder you’re an Overwatch fan too! Yet I feel like I don’t know you as a person. Gonna have to change that and pay more attention to our tweets!
  @aerincreer @Soundsbysoy @JESSrelax @Eye_Kyu @godhateskris @sophia57910384 @mattdkerr @mayowa4321 @hancockonetwo Some do and some don't. And some people definitely take video gaming, 2k included, as a way of life. Some people on this thread even say they think of it as a job opportunity. They're not as different as you'd think. You're just ignorant of one and not the other, that's all.

  One day I’ll break the record for the longest gaming marathon
  Last couple of months (including CES) I've been watching the television (and gaming monitor) market, and it's fascinating. But, similarly to everything else, the giant quality of life problems have been solved. Slowly, that innovation is trickling down to the budget TV's.

  I'll admit, there is one polarizing trait I have with video games and gaming writing. I like everything! There are few games I don't like. However, that also is a trait I need to fix. When to be critical but constructive if something. If a game is bad, it's bad.

  @FoxBusiness @williamsidopise America didn't love Trump... barely 1/4 of the country supports him and voted for him. He won by gaming the EC, with lots of help from fake news aimed specifically at the proudly ignorant MAGA klan with their pure hatred and spite. Trump is a joke by any measure.

  @cjwardart Depends on what you’re planning on doing with it. Movies, gaming? Console type? If it’s just for bluray then there is a difference provided that the source is a UHD Bluray and not a normal 1080P one where you won’t see that big of a deal.

  @BeastFireTimdog I suggested something like this a long time ago. Iit’s a no brainer for the consumer but why would they? It would be $180/yr as is so I really doubt they’ll take a 44% hit to bring it down to $100 if they don’t have to. It’s still the best value proposition currently in gaming

  If you dont know anything about gaming just dont simply make a statement to the others about being noob while he\she using good peripheral such as steel series, razer, logitech, and much more. Just mind your own business. Everyone has to start somewhere. Bye 
  @verdict4489 @erret84 @Puertorock77_ @MarkWoodland76 Yup. Google, Facebook, and Amazon want bigger stakes in the Console / PC gaming market. They are what the incumbents MS and Sony will have to deal with in the medium term.
  Idk why this narrow minded people think when someone buy some good peripheral for gaming and secara tak langsung dia mesti or wajib pro in any games. Come on dude, we buy all those things becoz of its comfort and ergonomic for gaming.

  Sex in Hollywood is fine, but in videogames it's a fucking sin.Sex work is a fine job but grid girls and booth babes are being objectified.Women in gaming should be treated equal but you're not allowed to treat them like you would other gamers when playing vs them. #clownworld

  @verdict4489 @MarkWoodland76 @FreeJAC Wrong. If it was dead then all future games wouls still be playable on PS4 but they won’t. Sony will cut off PS4 and the only place to play Sony exclusives will be on PS5 or better put, next gen console. BC doesn’t change the system of generational gaming.

  @jasonschreier Streaming is definitely the way gaming is moving. Cloud based processing with 4K streamed back over hi-speed broadband. The console then becomes nothing more than a conduit and local storage.
  @SpawnWaveMedia 946 reviews on something that dropped a few hours ago... It's likely they're being trolled early and hard. I'm not surprised, especially with the way PC gaming culture is all about trolling and trying to bring everything down, no matter how good something is.

  Second, the increased gaming time does not appear to be uniform across this age range. Instead, it looks like men born after 1985 have tended to delay the dropoff in gaming a bit further into their 20s.
